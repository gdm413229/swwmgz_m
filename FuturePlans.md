  7. Blackfire Igniter *(UnSX 5, Ultra Suite 3)*
  8. Rail Carbine *("Tesla Beamer" in Ultra Suite 2 & 3)*

  - Hoagie *(Can't eat it, but looks delicious)*
  - Lithium - Volume One *(A work of art, one of the finest graphic novels)*

  - **[Heretic]** Doomguy Action Figure *("Oh, he gets one too?")*
  - **[Hexen]** Obelisk of the Golden Vale *("I puked out my guts when I touched that fucking thing")*
