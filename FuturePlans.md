This is just a bit of *"future planning"* for stuff that I ***might*** add later on.

## 1.2 update *(A Needed Change)*:

I REALLY need to do this, it's starting to become very problematic to maintain the Demolitionist Menu as-is.

* **Demolitionist Menu Refactor:**
  - Non 16:10 ratio support
  - Smooth scrolling, better mouse input
  - Much cleaner code, easier maintenance and extension
  - Modular design, add-on tab support
* **Achievement CVar Compression:**
  - Switch achievements to use a dictionary, rather than individual CVars
  - Potentially more robust (maybe?)
  - Harder to tamper with
  - Can keep state in a local Dictionary object to avoid excess CVar access
* **Original English Voice Acting**

## 1.3 update *(The Second Batch)*:

More weapons, because we need 'em.

* **DLC Weaponset:**
  - [1] Itamex Reinforced Hammer *(UnSX 5)*
    - HAHA DAB *(Gib 200 enemies with the Itamex Hammer)*
  - [2] Plasma Blaster *(SWWM)*
    - Blastin' Plasma *(Kill an enemy at full health with a Plasma Blaster charged shot 50 times)*
  - [3] Puntzer Beta *(SWWM Iridium)*
    - High Noon *(Land 6 killing shots in a single Puntzer Beta reload)*
  - [4] Puntzer Gamma *(Ultra Suite 2)*
    - You Gained Brouzouf *(Unload an entire mag in fuller auto with the Puntzer Gamma without missing a single shot)*
  - [5] Sheen HMG *(SWWM Platinum Ep2)*
    - Dakka *(Fire the Sheen HMG for one minute straight)*
  - [6] Quadravol *(UnSX)*
    - Gravely Roast *(Perform 50 bayonet combos with the Quadravol)*
  - [7] Blackfire Igniter *(UnSX 5, Ultra Suite 3)*
    - Ice Ice Baby *(Impale 40 enemies with the Blackfire Igniter secondary)*
  - [8] Rail Carbine *("Tesla Beamer" in Ultra Suite 2 & 3)*
    - John Romero's Curse *(Fry yourself by discharging an electric weapon in water)*
  - [9] Ray-Khom *(UnSX)*
    - The Most Silent Takedown *(Kill 30 enemies with the Ray-Khom primary without alerting them)*
  - [0] Grand Lance *(SWWM Iridium)*
    - Penetrator *(Strike through 20 enemies in a row with a single Grand Lance secondary)*

## 1.4 update *(Arsenal Appendix)*:

A couple extra weapons, not enough for a full batch, but still worthy additions.

* **DLC Weaponset 2:**
  - [1] Hand of Divine *(Total Madness)*
    - Facepunching Extraordinaire *(Kill 300 enemies with the Hand of Divine)*
  - [6] Sparkster x3 *(UnSX 2)*
    - A Fine Sparking *(Kill 30 enemies at once with a Sparkster Rifle combo shot)*
  - [9] Mortal Rifle *(UnSX 2)*
    - Railed Hard *(Shoot through 16 enemies with a single Mortal Rifle overpressure shot)*
  - [0] Rafan-Kos *(UnSX 4)*
    - Blasting Ropes *(Melt a grand total of 1000 enemies with the Rafan-Kos)*

  - Tetris
  - Pong
  - Snake
  - **[Doom]** Demo Land Adventure *(platformer with shooty gameplay)*
  - **[Heretic]** Interstellar Demolitionist *(a somewhat simple vertical SHMUP, kinda Touhou styled)*
  - **[Hexen]** Demolition Quest *(a JRPG, kinda like early FF / BoF)*
* **Mothgirl summon for Lämp easter egg**
  - Layers of White *(Summon the White Lady)*
* ***(Maybe)* Replace all hitscan with *"light projectiles"***
* **Additional gestures + gesture menu**
  - Clap
  - The Bird
    - How Very Brutal *(Flip off 20 enemies)*
  - Thumbs Down
  - Giggle
  - Shrug
  - Beckon
* **Photo Mode**
  - Dedicated poses
  - Stickers
* ***(Maybe)* Virtual Training Map**

## Unspecified

Things that I'm unsure whether or not they'll be made.

* **Japanese localization???**
* ***(Maybe)* Fake livestream chat overlay, with dynamic reactions to all sorts of stuff**
* **Customized cluster text stuff if that ever gets scriptified**
