**Extra things after release:**

 - DLC weaponset
 - Additional collectibles not added due to time constraints
 - Additional achievements
 - "White Lady" rare LÃ¤mp spawn
 - More intermission art (shamefully e-begging on Twitter as usual orz)
 - Extra localizations (including Japanese)
 - Mod trailer video (doubt I'd be able to, I might ask someone instead)
 - Rewrite the entire Demolitionist Menu code from the ground up to be more easily extensible and adapt to any window size
 - Hexen key and puzzle item models?
 - DLC gameset

**Very extra things for the future:**

 - Modeled Monster/Decoration replacers for all IWADs done in the style of the mod (will be very time consuming)
 - Another DLC weaponset
 - Official DM map pack
 - Official IWAD
