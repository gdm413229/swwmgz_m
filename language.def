"Welcome to your first mission, Demolitionist. I'll be very direct here, the situation is very fucked. Things don't look good at all. Those fucking UAC idiots have done their worst and now we're paying for it. FUCK... THE... UAC... Seriously. If that damn brat Kelliher didn't have me blocked I'd be sending him all sorts of shit right now, you can't even begin to imagine HOW fucking pissed I am...\n"
"\n"
"It all happened so fast that... we didn't really have much time to prepare for it. Half of Earth got entirely taken over now. It's all mostly just the western countries, with the epicenter on Union States territory, where you'll be deployed. What pisses me off the most is that I can't get in touch with the Lunar Capital, it's like they're actively ignoring us or something. Fucking hell, it could have been our chance to contact the Nukuri and ask for help, but nope, we're on our own. We... have to do our best to fight these damn things, all by ourselves. That's where you come in.\n"
"\n"
"It is your mission to put an end to this, there are people out there fighting, we don't know how many, who still haven't been evacuated. It's Hell on Earth thanks to the amazing and great UAC shoving their stinky-ass fingers into what they shouldn't. Do they even know... How many of my friends I've lost... all the thousands, tens of thousands or even more, that just... couldn't make it. WW3 was nothing compared to this. It's just... ugh... And the fucker has the BALLS to just go and act like everything's fine and will be fixed soon. I want to punch that smug bastard... damn it.\n"
"\n"
"*sigh*\n"
"\n"
"Enough grieving... it's all about the mission now. I seriously don't have much faith on the UAC's so-called \"problem solver\", but WE can do it. Me and a couple others have joined up to make this happen, you're going to save those people. It'll be hard, I know, but you can do it, that's why I built you. If there's even a chance that you'll succeed, I want to tell you that I will personally reward you, Demo-chan. I'm not going to give you any details, I want it to be a surprise.\n"
"\n"
"We haven't been able to provide you with all the available equipment, there was no time for that. Instead, be on the lookout for strategically placed supplies along the way (hopefully the demons won't touch the stuff). I know that sounds kind of videogamey, and if I hear you complain you can eat my pants, I wasn't the one who made that decision. Whatever.\n"

"Welcome to your second mission, Demolitionist. While things have calmed down over here, we've been able to resume our work on the Akari Project. You know, the important one I've wanted to work on all my life. So far it's been a success, and you'll be the first to take part in the exploration of other worlds. We've scoured the multiverse for all sorts of interesting places, and this one in particular caught our eye. It is called Parthoris, it's a realm of magic and elves and stuff, I dig it. Anyway, I hope the ride wasn't too bumpy, we haven't fine-tuned that yet.\n"
"\n"
"Here's the situation: This place was divided in seven kingdoms, and all was good™ until some evildoer wizard of sorts popped up and brainwashed everyone. The only ones who resisted were the elves, the Sidhe (how do you even pronounce that). I don't like where this is going already, and I would hate to see a repeat of what we went through, so you're here to put a stop to it.\n"
"\n"
"Your objective is a man called D'Sparil. He's a member of a triad of crazy-ass evil sorcerers called the \"Serpent Riders\". Guy's tall, wears red robes, and talks backwards, can't miss him. He commands armies of undead and shit, nothing you can't deal with, I'm sure. First of all, you'll need to make contact with the Sidhe survivors, see if you can gather any more information on where to go and what to do. Maybe once it's all over we can probably form an alliance or something, and hopefully they won't be pissed that we use wooden furniture.\n"
"\n"
"I'm sure, that once you come back you'll want to transfer over to your maidbot body again, so I'll be working on a couple \"extensions\" there to make things more... \"fun\", if you catch my drift. Oh, I'm in the mood for something long... and hard... right now, yes...\n"
"\n"
"So... uh... horniness aside, I'm sorry that we couldn't give you all your stuff. I'm taking the blame this time, I think I screwed something up with the deployment and it got scattered all over the place. It's possible that the locals may have moved it around so... good luck finding it all.\n"

"\n"
"Welcome to Cronos. This place used to be nice, until that guy came in stomping around with his armies. Like the wizard dude, this fucker even got some of the locals on their side. Your target is called Korax, like the raven, huh, y'know, \"Corvus Corax\"... ah, forget it.\n"
"\n"
"So the thing is, I'd like you to step in and take him out. Do NOT listen to anything he says, as I bet he'll probably try to get to you too. He's big, ugly, and doesn't look much like the type who'd be capable of riding a serpent, so maybe... he's the one who gets a riding... oh wait no, that doesn't sound very... UGH... baaaaad mental image, holy fuck. Where are Ibuki's tiddies when you need 'em, they're the best at making me forget about everything.\n"
"\n"
"I know you'll want a nice reward for this so, here's what I have in mind. How about some more of that \"fun\" we had last time, hm? You, me, maybe Ibuki and Maidbot too... and I wonder... if Kirin-kun also... hnnn... and then... *heavy breathing*\n"
"\n"
"OK, wow... phew. Saya, focus. No hornyposting on mission statments, not again. Anyway, bad-ish news??? We got a mixup on the ammo stuff and instead we got these weirdass \"Fabricator\" things from that nerdo. They do provide ammo, at least. As usual, your equipment will be strategically placed here and there, since we couldn't just... send you in with ALL of it at once, again. I don't know why nerdo boy insists on doing things like this. Does he really want everything to be so... ugh... videogamey?\n"

While initially just a small robot workshop, they quickly grew over time, covering more diverse fields in the process. One of the labs' most popular products are the Maidbots, life-like humanoid assistant bots that can be freely adopted by any household: \"from energetic, workaholic maids that do their job without asking questions, to tender, motherly maids who take special care of you and encourage you to improve your lifestyle\". The labs are also famous for the creation of Ibuki, the \"Red Oni\", a WW3 veteran supersoldier, now turned supermodel, and in recent years, her successor, the Demolitionist.\n"

She is also a masterful painter and sculptor, with some of her works selling for millions.\n"

"\n"
"Summary: Founded in 1924 by Daniel Ischer as \"Schwarzmann Exotischwaffen\", an \"exotic weapons\" workshop in Cologne. Their slogan is \"if you can imagine it, we can build it\". Rose to fame when the family escaped to America in 1933. After settling in, the shop \"americanized\" itself under the current brand of \"Blackmann Arms\", and quickly rose to fame designing all sorts of ingenious weaponry for the allied forces. During WW3 they moved back to Germany, where they've stayed to this day. The company is currently run by Hermann E. Ischer, great-great-grandson of the original founder, who has made it a personal goal that as long as any commissioned weapon can hold more than one bullet, it must have a built-in function for shooting everything as quickly as possible.\n"
"\n"
"Addendum: A big part of the company's funding comes from Mr. BIG SHOT Industries, which according to reports by Hermann himself, regularly commissions all sorts of ludicrous shotgun designs that no sane man would think of using.

One major discovery that not even the natives were aware of, was that of a ruined research facility in the wasteland planet of Sunkaeze, belonging to a defunct company named \"Decade Mechanics\", run by the long-dead mechanical demigod Maester Mekes. Research material, blueprints and even finished, still functioning products have been found within, giving a general idea of what this facility was specialized in. Various groups have successfully recreated items entirely off their original blueprints, some of which have been commercial successes in the military field.\n"

"Date Of Birth: 2148-01-20\n"
"\n"
"Summary: The Demolitionist is a refinement of the former Red Oni supersoldier program, an AI-controlled combat unit capable of efficiently utilizing any weaponry at its disposition. It is equipped with a portable JetBurst Impulsor unit, allowing it to perform rapid mid-air boosts and dashes, it also comes equipped with two Hammerspace containers, for easy access to carried weapons and ammunition, the two, along with a keychain, being attached to a Magnetic Utility Belt. Its AI core is built on the same technology as Akari Labs' maidbots, the Nekuronbot AI framework, provided as a gift of friendship between Saya and Zanaveth II, the current head of Nekuratek. Thanks to this technology, and combined with a CuteEmotion Display, the Demolitionist is barely indistinguishable from a real person in its behaviour and emotional response, which makes interaction with civilians more comforting. The first unit was deployed in June of 2148 on Union States territory in order to combat the demonic invasion brought upon by the UAC's interventions on Hell.\n"
"\n"
"Addendum: Many more details are known about the first Demolitionist thanks to a Q&A session livestreamed by Saya Miyamoto. The unit's full name is \"Demo Miyamoto\", as given by Saya herself. They identify as non-binary, and remark that along with they/them, she/her pronouns are also acceptable. Personality-wise, they can be described as \"quite chatty\", fond of joking around and trying to put a smile on people's faces, but also very serious and determined in their desire to protect those in need. Demo also wears a \"Lucky Collar\" as a token of friendship from Saya, though most people remark that it looks like some sort of BDSM accessory.\n"

In a mere three years she was ready, thanks to an accelerated growth process. She's been enhanced to be effectively bulletproof, always standing strong under any circumstance, capable of handling extreme heat and cold, and trained for handling all kinds of weaponry. Despite all this, not long after she was deployed, the US were struck by an orbital strike, this event was known as the \"White Scar\". For years Ibuki wandered the wastelands, until she was finally retrieved by Taro Miyamoto and brought back to Japan.\n"

After all was over, the Nukuri would begin to make themselves at home among us.\n"

"Summary: The Nukuri are a snow-skinned humanoid race native to the frozen moon of Nahkami, in the Xathar System (part of the X'Animen Coalition), who came into contact with humans in what's known as the \"Luna Event\". Their civilization has had a long history of war and conflict, something which came to an eventual end following a seventh world war and a massive political and economic reform known as the \"Nos-Kora Ultimatum\". Before this, Nahkami was a ruthless, warmongering empire ruled with an iron fist by the Yathai royal family. Following the reform, emperor Ledora Yathai was forced into exile and the Nukuri Unified Government was created, with Zanata Nekuraku II elected as president. As someone who had suffered the loss of her family and husband in the previous wars, Zanata had been heavily opposed to the decision of attacking humans, and tried her best to make amends with us following the \"White Scar\" incident, but nothing came of it. As of this article's writing, she is no longer involved in politics. The current president of Nahkami is Saya Kowayanau, who is also the gobernor of the state of Saya.\n"
"\n"
"Addendum: The Nukuri Unified Government describes itself as a communist \"omnicracy\", where each state, each province, each district, elects their own representatives, fractally: everything is effectively voted by all people in the nation. There is no concept of private property, all previous businesses are now publicly owned, however with their founders still managing things. The Nukuri possess a military force, but they generally only serve to defend the nation from external threats.\n"

"Addendum: Ever since the incident, the company has gone through a major reform, having lost most of its leading staff, and is now tightly supervised by the Union States government. Since 2150, they have made it their goal to repair the damages Earth had suffered. There are currently no clear estimates of how long this may take.\n"

"\n"
"Summary: Misa is the lead weapon and armor designer of the entire Unissix family. Starting at a very early age, her fascination with weaponry has always been quite noticeable. Despite a strong fighting spirit, she lacks the physical prowess required to be a warrior, so she's dedicated herself entirely to her craft. Misa is highly skilled in the interpretation of ancient designs, and is thus often tasked with recreating lost technology. This has included the various Artifacts of Nedoshiaan.\n"
"\n"
"Addendum: Rose to fame on Earth during a visit from Zanaveth II, her wife, who leads Nekuratek, a massive tech giant in the Nukuri homeworld. Misa is a big fan of videogames, finding it rather exciting to finally be able to go on adventures of her own, without having to put much physical effort into it.\n"
"\n"
"Saya's Note: I remember having some chats with her. She's got good taste, and her wife is hot af (and really smart, I mean she made the AI you're built on). I'm still pissy that we haven't been in contact much thanks to those American idiots causing the Nukuri to leave. I could send messages sometimes through the embassy in the Lunar Capital, but those damn bunnies always made it hard. BTW... I remember this one time we took a bath together and I saw... her down there... omg... huge... ohhhhhhh......

"Summary: A rather unconventional 25-barrel revolving shotgun. Its internal mechanisms are so overtly complicated that they've been described as \"Kraut Deep Space Magic\" by some.\n"
"\n"
"Primary Fire: Shoots the barrel at the top.\n"
"\n"
"Secondary Fire: Shoots the 5-barrel group at the top.\n"
"\n"
"Tertiary Fire: Shoots all barrels. With some types of ammunition it is possible to breach reinforced steel doors up to 40cm in thickness.\n"

"\n"
"Primary Fire: Charges a beam shot. Once complete, pulling the trigger releases it. The beam will instantly destroy everything in its way, no matter how tough it is.\n"
"\n"
"Secondary Fire: Charges a vortex shot. Once complete, pulling the trigger releases it. On the impact area a miniature black hole will be created which will swallow everything around itself for a period of time before collapsing in a devastating explosion.\n"
"\n"
"Reloading: If there's any ongoing charge process, it will be cancelled and no ammunition will be used, but the weapon will have to vent for a while. Otherwise, loads a new crystal.\n"

"\n"
"Summary: In June of 2073, the President of the United States made some very insulting comments about the Nukuri, who were currently in the middle of their 7th World War. They were not very well received. Many Nukuri previously settled on Earth migrated in protest, the emperor of Nahkami had many things to say, and the ball just kept rolling. In no time, the conflict reached its boiling point, and the Nukuri Empire declared war on the US, ready to launch a direct attack as \"punishment for their insolence\". Ground units were deployed in September of 2074, and thus the war began. There were many loses for both sides, in their attempt to \"slay the beast from within\", however, in just three more years, the entire country had fallen. The president was then given a choice: either publicly apologize for his words against the Nukuri Empire, or watch as the wrath of the Emperor falls upon his people. He rejected this proposition, and all Nukuri forces were ordered to leave the area. Then, it happened: With a blinding flash of light, an orbital strike hit several major US cities, reducing them to ashes. Most people who were indoors at the time survived, the rest were not so lucky.\n"
"\n"
"Addendum: When news broke of what had happened on Earth, protests broke out all over the Nukuri Empire, further fueling the still ongoing WW7. Chaos ensued for almost 30 years, until the founders of the University of Nos-Kora stepped in, and put a stop to the war all by themselves. Their ultimatum was taken very seriously, and thus a massive reform began, starting with the Emperor being forced out into exile, never to be allowed to return. The reform reached its climax in 2108, with the formation of the Nukuri Unified Government. Despite all this, relations with the Nukuri were never truly restored, with the exception of various previously allied countries, such as Scotland and Japan.\n"
"\n"
"Saya's Note: Man, this was one of the darkest moments in history. Really fucks me up thinking about it again, especially after I had learned from Zana-sama how things were on the other side. The Nukuri folks were anything but peaceful back in the day, but only because the guy running the show was a fucking megalomaniac asshole supervillain, like fucking hell, toasting the entire US for a BUNCH OF TWEETS. Practically everyone in there turned on him when it happened. The fucker signed his own death sentence right there. On top of that having those two weirdos step in and just... ENDING the war by themselves. Good lord, I hope I never piss them off.";

During the first days following the \"Luna Event\", it was discovered that our own solar system had a portal connecting to them, in the remote dwarf planet of Sedna, from which the Nukuri had come to our world in order to study us as potential candidates for joining the group. The current member systems are Xathar (where the Nukuri homeworld is), Zenna, Mondakan and Kryudon.\n"

"\n"
"Summary: Zanaveth III is the sole daughter of Misa Unissix and Zanaveth II. She had a quite troubled childhood, suffering bullying for years due to her odd personality and mannerisms. After graduating from the University of Nos-Kora in 2140, she went on to pursue her lifelong goal of \"taking over the world\".\n"
"\n"
"Addendum: Zanaveth's negative world view and hostile attitude towards other people could be seen as a direct consequence of her experiences growing up. She rarely opens up to anyone, except her own parents, and also Saya, due to the time they've spent together when her parents visited.\n"
"\n"
"Saya's Note: Zana-chan may look all cold and stuff but under all of that she's very emotional, real sensitive. She'd often crash at my place after getting in trouble, coming in all flustered and angry, and I'd offer a shoulder to cry on, some nice headpats and hugs, and she'd calm down. It's... honestly heartwarming, makes me feel like a mom, in a way. I wonder what she's up to now, haven't seen her in a while. Ahhhh... I miss petting that soft and fluffy hair of hers...";
