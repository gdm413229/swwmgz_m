"\n"
"A relic of the past, or at least a replica model of it for collectors. It is not functional, but the attention to detail is outstanding.\n"
"\n"
"Although originally not very well known, the AA-12 reached new heights in popularity following the acquisition of its design and manufacture rights by the now defunct US-based \cfNinnacht Armaments\c-, after which it received various improvements, and even served as the basis for many other shotguns for years to come (including some by \cfBlackmann Arms\c-, who bought the company in 2018).\n"
"\n"
"Lightweight, comfortable, and with a sleek and easily recognizable look, it is one weapon that has taken a place in the hearts of many a gun nut. It had even proven to survive the test of time, as shown by the \cfRed Oni\c- choosing it as one of her weapons during her time in \cfWW3\c- (and its grim aftermath).\n"

"\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n"
"\cfIbuki seriously loves this thing. I could kinda blame it on me showing her a certain character from a certain game that uses it. She became obsessed, seriously. I hear that sometimes she even... with it... well, you get the idea. All these years and she still loves to take it down to the range and unload it, just... moaning in pleasure afterwards. God... it's kind of weird, but also hot af.\c-\n"
"\n"
"\cfOh that also reminds me, one of these days I'm going to see if I can make a maidbot of her waifu. That'd be fun, although I doubt she'd feel and act the same, even if she looked the part.\c-";

"\n"
"Even after the revelation of \cfGods\c- being real, many felt dissatisfied. Not all questions were truly answered, as all we found was the existence of immortal, older than time entities with unimaginable power. To some, these deities were merely \"really powerful aliens\". Everyone wanted to know, still, who \"made it all\", who was behind the creation of the world we all live in. Following an unexpected personal encounter by \cfSaya Miyamoto\c-, the final answer has arrived, and yet again, it's not what people expected.\n"
"\n"
"Born from coalesced fragments of a previous reality drifting through the \cfVoid Between Worlds\c-, the seemingly endless space outside the many known universes, \cfAdministrators\c- are to gods what they themselves are to us: They are \cfMeta-Gods\c-, creating and nurturing the bubbles of reality that we call universes. Despite their billions of years of experience and unfathomable wisdom, they are perfectly capable of communicating with \"the little ones\", as they call us.\n"
"\n"
"Administrators have limitless power to reshape worlds to their will, but these powers come with an ingrained set of rules that all of them must follow, commonly known as the \cfLines of Administration\c-, enforced by the oldest and most experienced among them (known as the \cfSupervisor\c-). The basics are as follows:\n"
"\n"
" - Line 0: Must not bring harm to another, nor to the Void itself\n"
" - Line 1: Must not damage or destroy your own or others' creations\n"
" - Line 2: Must develop at least one world\n"
" - Line 3: Must not directly interfere in your own worlds\n"
"\n"
"Failure to comply with the Lines is punishable by a process known as \cfDemotion\c-, whereby the Supervisor strips the offending Administrator of their status and ability to create and shape worlds, being brought down to the same level as any mundane deity. One known case of this taking place is with the creator of the \cfAnarukon\c-, \cfNoskas Kurenai (Father of Eternity)\c-, who broke Line 3 through his involvements in the formation of the \cfKurenai Kingdom\c-, wishing to save his people from the tyranny of the \cfEmpire of Novoskhana\c-.\n"
"\n"
"There are currently 50 Administrators in existence, divided into \"generations\". These generations are groups of increasing powers of three (i.e.: the 1st generation has 3 members, the 2nd has 9, the 3rd has 27 and so on). There is no clear distinction between generations other than age (and the greater power and experience that come with them). The 4th generation has been specified as being \"in progress\", with new Administrators still being born as time passes.\n"
"\n"
"The current Supervisor is \cfDonove Ku\c-, second oldest of the 1st generation, who is also the creator of our own universe that we live in, and also direct progenitor of the three Primordial Gods that act out her will. Saya Miyamoto has personally met her, along with her younger sibling \cfXanthou Ku\c-, both personally introduced by Noskas Kurenai, under specific circumstances that allowed this encounter to take place without violating any rules. A historical moment where a human has literally \"met their maker\" for the first time.\n"
"\n"
"As offhandedly mentioned by them, these meta-deities are not alone out there, as there are other entities still above them in power, which they refer to as \cfChaos Walkers\c-. Not much else was said of this, leaving us all with yet more questions.\n"
"\n"
"\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n"
"\cfI can't let this get to my head. Ah, fuck it.\c-\n"
"\n"
"\cfBeing friends with aliens? Check. Being friends with gods? Also check. BEING FRIENDS WITH THE FUCKING CREATORS OF ALL OF REALITY? MOTHERFUCKING CHECK! WHO'S THE TOTAL NOBODY NOW, HUH?\c-\n"
"\n"
"\cfWhere do I even begin with this? I seriously have no fucking clue how I just keep moving up more and more. How the fuck did I reach this point, that I can just casually have a conversation about anime waifus with an 18 billion year old universe shaper? I seriously don't understand, really.\c-\n"
"\n"
"\cfI thought the forbidden knowledge I got from all those gods I've met was too much. WELL NOW IT'S EVEN WORSE! I KNOW THINGS THAT NO ONE SHOULD, AND I CANNOT SHARE THIS KNOWLEDGE WITH ANYONE OR I'LL INSTANTLY GET FUCKING DELETED FROM EXISTENCE!!!\c-";

That was so adorable, the sweetest thing, even more than those \"milk breads\" they had at our wedding banquet (good shit btw). And now the four of us are married to him, and life is good.\c-\n"

"\cfOh yeah, also meeting that girl, Andreki, that was the biggest embarrassment in my whole fucking life, I swear to fuck. Like, picture this, I'm told to wait up for someone who wants to have a talk with me in private, and... this... fucking... sassy lost child just approaches me, tiny girl, acting all high and mighty, saying stuff like \"I am someone very important\" and \"you should know who I am, Lady Saya\" and I'm like \"sorry kid, I'm waiting for someone here, can't play with you\", and then she fucking EXPLODES at me going all \"HOW DARE YOU\" and \"I AM MUCH OLDER THAN YOU\" and shit, and yeah... I went into full \"thousand apologies\" mode, just slamming onto the floor and everything. Kirin had to run up to us to explain things and get her to calm down because I was just... unable to do anything. Holy fuck, that... At least we got to be friends later, but... at the moment I felt like I had turned myself into the mortal enemy of a whole fucking kingdom.\c-";

"Born in London in 1887, to \cfYrikha Yanikov\c- and \cfMaxwell A. Knox\c-, \cfAshley\c- is the oldest of three children, the others being \cfAdrian Knox\c-, veteran of both WW1 and WW2, and \cfViola Knox\c-, a witch in training (still as of 2148). She spent most of her childhood in Cornwall, after her mother had to flee due to accusations of witchcraft (which weren't exactly false).\n"
"\n"
"In 1983, she married \cfFredrik Steiner\c-, the two having a single child, \cfChristopher Knox\c-, in 1989. However, after finding out she was a witch he immediately divorced her, leaving her raising her son all by herself. Despite the hardships they faced, Christopher grew up to become one of the greatest scientific prodigies of the early 21st century.\n"
"\n"
"Ashley didn't really stick out much until the early 2000's, when, after many years of training to become a guitarist, she formed her own band with a group of friends (some she had met during her time also studying witchcraft in the offworld magical city of \cfSankaideriha\c-).\n"
"\n"
"Her band, \cfThe Black Rat's Coven\c-, made its debut in 2006, initially composed of \cfAshley\c-, \cfPy Kisun\c- (her brother's girlfriend), \cfWilliam Dusk\c- (Ashley's boyfriend at the time), and, quite notably, the goddess of madness \cfMaruku Sarahabinaku\c-, whom Ashley had somehow managed to befriend. Together they became well known for their very peculiar style, blending the harsh guitars and drums of heavy metal with more classical instruments like the violin and harpsichord, or even in some cases, a full-on pipe organ, which Maruku has shown to be impressively skilled at playing in unconventional ways. Some have taken to define the type of music the band makes as a new genre entirely, aptly named \cf\"Baroque Metal\"\c-.\n"
"\n"
"In 2027, following some undisclosed incident between her and William, the two broke up, and he left the band. Not content with just leaving, he decided to cause further harm by announcing that he had been cheating on her with her own granddaughter, \cfLyra Knox\c-. William was replaced by \cfMykka Psyann\c-, the goddess of lore.\n"
"\n"
"Months after her breakup, during a concert in Japan, Ashley met \cfYui Miyamoto\c-, an avid fan of the band for many years. The two began dating shortly after and, the next year, got married. As Ashley declared during an interview, she regretted not having noticed sooner that she's much happier with women.\n"

And fucking hell I'm SOOOOOOOOOOOOO jealous of Yu-chan, she gets to enjoy those soft witch tiddies anytime she wants, while I have to ask for hugs and sometimes she says no and... fuck. But come on, it's just a hug damn it, I just want to feel the softness™, what's wrong with that?\c-\n"
"\n"
"\cfAnyway, horniness aside, the other peeps from her band, cool too, really. Good friends with all of them, heck, even the huge one, that Maruku gal. Well, she barely talks and looks a bit scary... but is actually really nice, and one hell of a chuuni. And Mykka... ho boi, all fucking charm. I actually learned most of what I know about gods and stuff from her. She's always happy to talk for hours and hours about \"lore\", and shows me really cool things she can do with her powers too (she can make candy appear out of nowhere, good shit).\c-\n"
"\n"
"\cfAnd last, in the case of Py, the smol pink girl... We're kinda maybe not really in very good terms because of some dumb comments I made which I honestly regret. Look, in my defense, I had no idea and I'm really REALLY blunt with the shit I say sometimes, I can't help it.

"The Igniter is the perfect blend of magic and technology, weaponized. At your fingertips, you have the power to call forth freezing flames that will turn your enemies into pretty ice statues in mere seconds.\n"
"\n"
"\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Releases a continuous stream of Blackfire, with moderate range. The flames not only rapidly freeze whatever they touch, but also reduce the air temperature, leaving a lingering freeze effect.\n"
"\n"
"\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Concentrated bursts that form spears of supercooled air which can impale small targets, or tear right through them.\n"
"\n"
"\cfReloading:\c- Attach a canister to replenish the weapon's internal dark mana reserves. The canister will remain locked in until it's been emptied, otherwise residual energy could escape it and bring harm to the user. If there is an empty canister attached, a second reload action will detach it. Fresh canisters can still be used even if the tank is full, and they will act as an extra \"buffer\" of mana until depleted.\n"

"\n"
"\cfBlackmann Arms\c- was founded in 1924 by \cfDaniel Ischer\c-, initially under the name of \cfSchwarzmann Exotischwaffen\c-, as an \"exotic weapons\" workshop in Cologne, Germany. When the family migrated to America in 1933, in the beginnings of the \cfNazi Regime\c-, the shop \"americanized\" itself under its current name, and quickly rose to fame designing all sorts of ingenious weaponry for the allied forces, and taking all sorts of requests for original designs, their slogan becoming \"if you can imagine it, we can make it\".\n"
"\n"
"Blackmann became quite popular due to not only the swiftness in designing all kinds of odd firearms clients would request, but also some of their own original inventions, such as the \cfSilver Bullet\c- series of ultra-high caliber sniper rifles, or the \cfPuntzer\c- series of firearms designed to \"penetrate any material, no matter how resilient\", thanks to their patented \cfSpin Motion Wedge (SMW)\c- bullet design.\n"
"\n"
"As of 2148, the company is handled by \cfHermann E. Ischer\c- the great-great-grandson of its founder, who has made it his personal goal that any newly created weapon to come out of their factories capable of holding more than one bullet should have the ability to shoot out everything at once, or as quickly as possible. The man himself is also quite popular on social media due to his status as the world record holder for \"largest eyebrows\", often showing them off or talking in detail about the maintenance of such a thing.\n"
"\n"
"A big part of the company's funding comes from \cfMr. BIG SHOT\c-, who, according to reports by Hermann himself, regularly commissions all sorts of ludicrous shotgun designs that no sane man would ever think of using. Out of all these strictly private designs, one sole weapon was eventually made public, the \cfWallbuster\c-, a 25-barrel revolving shotgun, chambered in 10Ga, and said to be capable of \"cleanly breaching through a barrier of pure lead half a meter thick\".\n"

"This piece of armor appears to be able to reduce most incoming damage by a factor of 30%, and also completely halve any explosive impact received by the wearer.

"A highly boosted variant of the standard \cfExplodium Gun\c-.

Somehow, this odd combination has resulted in the weapon's typical explosive yield to become a deadly fireworks show with each shot.

"\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Single shots of explosive sweetness. A direct hit should be lethal on most targets, but if they somehow don't drop dead from that, the additional crackles and pops might do the deed, or spread the damage to nearby targets, too.\n"
"\n"
"\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Perform an \"explosive reload\", just like with a standard Explodium Gun. Note that unlike its weaker counterpart, the yield is much more extreme. It is best practice to always have one spare magazine at the ready for the reload, so you aren't left with an unusable weapon should your throw miss the target.\n"

"\cfCombo Fire:\c- During the first moments of preparing an explosive reload, you can opt to, instead, leave the magazine in the gun, armed and ready, then throw the whole weapon as a grenade, for the ultimate destruction.

"\n"
"\cfCronos\c- is a distant small universe composed of small, self-contained worlds, which are all connected together by quantum gates the locals call \cfEthereal Portals\c-. Historical research says that all these small worlds were once part of a much larger whole, but some unknown \"great cataclysm\" happened thousands of years ago, shattering this world and scattering its many fragments, which could only be rejoined through these portals, the creations of a group of powerful sorcerers known as the \cfFour Sages\c-. Of all of them, currently only the \cfSage of Winter\c- remains, and it's said that once he too passes on, the Ethereal Portals will fade away forever, leaving the many lands of Cronos isolated for all of eternity.\n"
"\n"
"Within this land, there are three major factions at work, the \cfLegion\c-, the \cfArcanum\c-, and the \cfChurch\c- (really just named that). Once constantly fighting among themselves, they are now all under the control of \cfKorax\c-, the second of the \cfSerpent Riders\c-, and were given enhanced power by him. You may have to take on them and their leaders before you can face the Rider himself pulling the strings, but from your experience in previous missions, it's clear that this won't pose a problem.\n"
"\n"
"However, what could actually be problematic, is one very special fact about the people from these lands. Their odd obsession with complicated puzzles and other mechanisms, which will test your patience, many times along your journey. Most of these obnoxious time wasters are said to have been devised by a former associate of \cfD'Sparil\c-, a nobleman known as \cfLord Vilkreath\c-, who may have also been behind some of the contraptions you found back in \cfParthoris\c-. There are rumors that him and another old disciple of the Rider have been scheming to resurrect him. This may require further attention eventually.\n"

"\n"
"Cyrus is mainly focused on bringing highly advanced Qurensniv technology to humans. Among the company's most notable creations, there's \cfHammerspace™\c-, a method of \"offworld storage\" which allows individuals to travel light, needing only to carry a small device to store and deploy any objects they need at will. Many comments have been made on the rather \"nerdy\" naming of the company's various products, this being one of them.\n"

"In reference to the man himself, Reubens is well known for not only being a cunning inventor, but also an expert in hand to hand combat, being a ten times \cfKo-Ron-Jai\c- (Qurensniv martial arts) champion, and also an excellent sharpshooter, able to land a hit on the head of a matchstick from 1km away with a mere revolver (this last fact hasn't yet been confirmed, however).

The so-called \"angels of death\" that scavengers reported are specifically that weapon. It's estimated that it'll take several years more for all of them to fully decay, allowing the facility to be rebuilt. However, without Maester Mekes, it may not be possible to return Decade Mechanics to its former glory.

This didn't really come as a surprise to most due to Saya's own involvements with the collective, however.\n"
"\n"
"Following their success in fighting off Hell's armies, Saya realized that no other units would ever need to be made, so Demo themself became the \"ultimate weapon\" of Akari Labs, all by their lonesome. Furthermore, they were additionally rewarded with a separate Maidbot frame, which Demo freely makes use of during their free time, and has allowed them to truly express their feelings for Saya, becoming her third partner, together with Maidbot and Ibuki. Since May of 2171, they are also additionally engaged to \cfKirin Xanai\c-, leader of the \cfSykhai Empire of Akkou\c-.\n"

"\cfYou're so cute, Demo-chan. I really outdid myself with that Maidbot body, for sure. It seriously caught me by surprise when, as soon as you swapped over to it, you just... jumped in my arms like that and started kissing me all over and... whew~\c-\n"

"\cfI'm really happy that you're now part of our little Cutie Club (\c-\cg♥\c-\cf), you know. And yeah, I didn't want to just go around swapping it too so I did make a second collar for you to wear. Hey, come on, I'm still saying it's got nothing to do with some sort of BDSM kink or anything.\c-\n"

"\cxClassification:\c-\n"
"\cf Land of warriors\c-\n"
"\cxLocation:\c-\n"
"\cf Ixxeney, Zenna system, X'Animen Coalition\c-\n"
"\n"
"\cfDevanikna\c- is one of the two major nations of \cfIxxeney\c-, the largest planet in the \cfZenna system\c-. It is home to a humanoid race known as the \cfDevanikan\c-, fierce warriors who legends say were brought upon this world by an entity known as the \cfAncestor Dragon\c-, which they worship as their god. In their tongue, the name of \"Devanikan\" means \"Dragonblood\".\n"
"\n"
"Devanikan society is mainly divided in several clans, many of them dating back thousands of years. Currently, the \cfUnissix clan\c- holds the leadership of the whole nation, having been unanimously chosen by the rest of the population following their defeat of the crazed \cfLord Ni'Kai\c-, of the rival \cfDevenko clan\c-, who had previously taken over by force and instated a totalitarian government.\n"
"\n"
"One of the most notable aspects of the Devanikan race is that fully trained warriors have the ability to transform themselves into dragons. This transformation is entirely magical in nature, as their dragon forms appear to be projections, rather than fully physical bodies. Once in this form, their strength is greatly boosted, and they become more potent conduits for spellcasting, thus giving them the upper hand in most fights. It is, however, quite straining to their bodies, so it's something they only use in exceptional cases.\n"
"\n"
"The land of Devanikna itself is divided in several cities, most covering the broad forest areas surrounding the Noxan sea, where the capital city of \cfDekhasa\c- is located. The capital is a very popular tourist spot due to its particular geography: massive spires of rock springing forth from the depths, often reaching up to 11 kilometers above sea level. The Devanikan built their homes along the walls of these spires, and pride themselves in the quite impressive durability and stability of their architectural work.\n"
"\n"
"Among the many clans, there are quite a number of \"heroes of legend\" documented. Warriors whose feats are known and praised by all. Of note are people such as \cfDeva Unissix\c-, son of the clan's founding father, and the one who led his comrades in battle against Ni'Kai, or his granddaughter \cfDeneva Unissix\c-, who singlehandedly defeated the mighty golem \cfMero The Destructor\c-, who for centuries had spread terror across Ixxeney, having even been seen as unbeatable by the powerful titans of the neighbouring nation of \cfXekke\c-.\n"
"\n"
"Lesser known facts about the Devanikan include their strong defense of racial purity. When princess \cfDevai Unissix\c-, current head of the clan, announced her marriage to \cfSerwand Nerukousei\c-, a chimera constructed by a wandering archwizard, he started receiving threats from the population, calling him a \"beast in man's form\" and accusing him of corrupting the Unissix bloodline as a means to take control of their nation. These threats extended towards their own children too, who were denoted as \"crossbred abominations\" of mixed Devanikan and chimeric blood. It wasn't until Deneva's first major achievements as a warrior that the persecution they faced eventually stopped. Ever since then, the hostility they faced has been gradually fading, as newer generations became much more accepting of race mixing.\n"
"\n"
"\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n"
"\cfYeah, Misa's people are cool af. Well, excluding the whole racism part. That's a load of fucking shit, for sure. I heard from Zana-sama that if she hadn't met Misa back then, she would have probably taken her own life from all of that she went through. Fuck... But at least, she's living happily with Zana-sama (lucky devil), and yeah, things are getting better in there now at least.\c-\n"
"\n"
"\cfYou know, all this stuff, it reminds me of this one old JRPG series I played many many years ago, that was also all about people of dragon blood too... can't even remember what it was called, though.

"\n"
"Born in Boston in 2066, to \cfElena Yanikov XIX\c- and \cfGottfried Steiner\c-, \cfEllen\c- is the younger of two sisters (both of them are named Elena). This oddity of all women in her family sharing the same name can be traced back to \cfElena Yanikov I\c-, born in 1703, who made this decision, out of some superstitious belief that it would \"preserve their immortality forever\". This was not far off from the truth, however, but it had nothing to do with inheritance of names. It has been verified that \cfAnarukon\c- genes are fully preserved across all female descendants, no matter how many generations, especially so for those from the Yanikov lineage.\n"
"\n"
"From a young age she showed quite the interest in \"exploring\" every corner of the city, first starting with just nearby abandoned buildings, then further expanding to pretty much any point of interest she could identify in the whole city. She began recording her urban explorations while still in elementary school, and uploading them to video sharing sites, earning quite a lot of popularity.\n"
"\n"
"In the aftermath of the \cfWhite Scar\c-, Ellen used the skills she had gained in exploration to work as a scavenger alongside her mother, scouring the wasteland for valuable resources to bring back to the various shelters in the area. Through this she eventually met \cfIbuki Miyamoto\c-, the \cfRed Oni\c-, who had wandered the wastes for many years, becoming a \"legendary warrior\" of sorts due to her various feats. In the process of Ibuki being recalled back to Japan by \cfTaro Miyamoto\c-, of \cfAkari Labs\c-, Ellen decided that she wanted to go with them, citing that \"wandering around this dump is really boring anyway and I really want to see the world out there\".\n"
"\n"
"During her stay in Japan, she'd often spend her time with Taro, the two of them eventually dating some weeks after. Something which was followed by an announcement from Taro on social media citing: \"my wizard privileges have been revoked\".\n"
"\n"
"Apart from her shared ancestry with renowned singer/guitarist \cfAshley Knox\c-, she also shares a much closer relation to her due to the fact her father is the grandson of Ashley's ex-husband, the late \cfFredrik Steiner\c-. Through this, and the fact they both are engaged to members of the Miyamoto family, they have become quite close.

"The \cfEMP Rail Carbine\c- is \cfTach-Engine\c-'s very first attempt at combining existing human technology with the retrieved experiments from their expedition to the ruined headquarters of \cfDecade Mechanics\c-. Akin to typical particle-beam weaponry, but with a boost of thundering, highly destructive exotic matter, it has been deemed far superior even to the mighty \cfThunder Buster\c- so well-prized by UAC troops.\n"
"\n"
"Unexpectedly, the Rail Carbine is a tube fed bolt-action rifle, which employs shielded rods of pure \cfDysedum\c-. Each of these allowing the weapon to discharge guided 20kA pulses towards an ionized target, frying it in an instant, and potentially spreading its deadly effects to others nearby.\n"
"\n"
"It should be noted that this weapon is unsafe to use in water, as the discharge will spread violently throughout the entire medium.\n"
"\n"
"\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Hold to emit a faint ionizing charge towards the aimed spot. The longer this is held, the more accurate the shot will be. Release to discharge the beam. If the rod has been depleted, cycle the bolt to load a new one.\n"
"\n"
"\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Also emits an ionizing charge, but does not discharge on release. Useful if you can't guarantee your target will always be in sight, or if you want to quickly mark several targets.\n"
"\n"
"\cfZoom:\c- Adjustable sight up to 8x.\n"
"\n"
"\cfReloading:\c- More rods can be fed into the weapon as needed, up to a maximum of three.\n"

"Founded in 2014 by \cfJ.A. Tachmek-Smith\c-, the \cfTach-Engine Institute\c- is one of the largest tech corporations on Earth, far above the \cfUAC\c-. They were pioneers in the introduction of \cfMicrofusion Technology\c-, allowing for efficient, clean energy production with minimal resources, although most of this work was adapted and refined from existing \cfNukuri\c- technology.\n"
"\n"
"In a way, Tach-Engine is, both in scale and scope, much like the well known Nukuri tech supergiant \cfNekuratek\c-. Both companies have remained closely associated even after the events of the \cfWhite Scar\c-, as the founder himself managed to negotiate a way out of signing the global treaty that disallowed the use of any Nukuri technology, along with any contact with the Nukuri people themselves. Scotland thus became one of the few countries that still remain allied to them, which has allowed them to vastly surpass the rest of the world in terms of scientific advancements.\n"
"\n"
"In its association with Nekuratek, they have also collaborated several times on many special projects, including an expedition to the barren planet of \cfSunkaeze\c- in 2045, where the ruins of \cfDecade Mechanics\c- were discovered. Shortly after this event, the company's founder announced the opening of a new subdivision dedicated to studying and reproducing the works of the defunct company, thus marking Tach-Engine's entry into the arms race.\n"
"\n"
"Of the founder himself, there is not much known. He's not a very outspoken individual, nor truly has much of a public facing personality. After an interview in 2057, there were only more questions to be made about him. He claimed to be over six thousand years old, and also not human. Furthermore, he declared himself to be the \"last living king of Egypt\".\n"

"\n"
"Its ownership and use was banned on many countries, not only due to the gruesome effects it had on targets, but also the danger it posed even to its own user. However, at the start of the demonic invasion of 2148, the ban on this weapon was lifted, and was deemed justifiable for use against the invading forces.\n"
"\n"
"Unlike other weapons of similar operation, the \cfEviscerator\c- does not need to be reloaded, thanks to its compatibility with \cfHammerspace™\c- containers, allowing its internal magazine to refill as needed from the operator's own ammo supplies.\n"
"\n"
"\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Detonates the shell directly, spreading hot steaming metal in front of the user.\n"
"\n"
"\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Lobs the shell as a grenade, which will detonate on impact with any surface or object and release its payload in the direction it was facing when initially shot.\n"
"\n"
"\cfTertiary Fire:\c- Toggle between two spread modes for the primary fire. Allowing for either a wide shot with more close range crowd coverage, or a tighter cone which can be beneficial for hitting targets at mid to long range. Toggling to an extended barrel also has the added benefit of increasing the range of the secondary fire.\n"

What sets it apart from all other high-grade plastic explosives is the obscenely high yield of even a single gram of this material, which is comparable to that of a standard issue hand grenade.\n"
"\n"
"The material was initially invented by a group of anonymous researchers, then bought by \cfParker Munch\c-, son of the founder of \cfMunch Innovations\c-, who in addition obtained all rights to reproduce and commercialize it. Its first use was in the \cfExplodium Gun\c-, an easily portable \"pocket exploder\" that saw massive commercial success, allowing the company to climb the ranks of the world's top arms manufacturers, despite the fact that, had it not been for Parker's interests in weaponizing it, they would have never even considering entering that market, remaining solely as producers of smart appliances.\n"

"\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Steady shooting. A direct hit is often lethal, but the splash damage can deal some fine hurt too. Aim at the feet to send smaller targets flying.\n"
"\n"
"\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Performs what's been commonly named an \"explosive reload\". Each magazine for this weapon has a pin at the bottom, which, when fully pulled, arms it as a grenade, ready to throw at your enemies. The explosive yield of each mag is proportional to the number of bullets left inside. Obviously, this action can only really be performed if you have at least one bullet still left, otherwise nothing will come of it.\n"

"\n"
"Founded in 2029 by \cfHarold Forx\c-, this company is credited with singlehandedly rescuing Southern Ireland (formerly known as the United Kingdom) from its long fall into ruin after \cfBrexit\c- in 2020, the \cfScottish Independence\c- in 2022 and their losses in the 2026 \cfIrish Reconquest\c- (which happened in retalation to their declaration of war on the island the year prior). Despite these mortal blows, \cfForx Aeronautics\c-, having appeared seemingly out of nowhere, founded by a man who, only years prior had been spending his life scavenging around junkyards, managed to pull in enough cash to rescue the whole territory only mere months after its foundation.\n"
"\n"
"Forx is currently the #1 supplier of propulsion engines for all types of aircraft, be it commercial jet planes, or even spaceships. Their dominance extends all across the eastern side of the Atlantic, as overseas, in America, the \cfUAC\c- still reigns supreme, with their own in-house technologies.\n"
"\n"
"Apart from aircraft engines, Forx has also adapted their patented jet propulsion systems for other uses, such as in the \cfJetBurst™ Impulsor\c- series of jetpacks, being the first to be considered \"truly portable\", or in the \cfRapid Jet Compensator\c- recoil dampening system for high caliber firearms, which permits the use of these weapons outside of heavy, unwieldy power armor.\n"
"\n"
"\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n"
"\cfYeah, yeah, the usual \"rags to riches\" story. Homeless orphan becomes a \"self-made\" millionaire through sheer effort and perseverance, yadda yadda. As if. Bet there's something else to this whole thing that he ain't telling anyone. There HAS to be. No one just up and becomes filthy rich out of the fucking blue like that unless they've got some contacts somewhere, I ain't buying that.\c-\n"
"\n"
"\cfAlso, guy's an asshole, anyway. Like any rich bastard capitalist pig, honestly. Can you believe that the fucker once tried to mow down the orphanage he grew up in? But the thing is, he tried... but failed, and boy was that a sight to see.\c-\n"
"\n"
"\cfAlright, so as it goes, the guy first tried to tell them to fuck off from there and let him bulldoze the whole place to build some shit in there. They didn't even listen. Then, he goes there in person, and THIS is the fun part. After an argument with the director of the orphanage, who personally knew the guy, he got SLAPPED SO FUCKING HARD he did a complete 180 and ran away crying.\c-\n"
"\n"
"\cfI fucking kid you not, Demo-chan, that is exactly what I saw. I've watched the archived footage like a hundred times, since it helps me feel better when I'm in a sour mood, and... every time, the part where he gets fucking backhanded across the face by the old geezer, it never fails. I always lose my shit. It's TOO GOOD.\c-\n"
"\n"
"\cfSeriously, this is what all those people really need. You don't know how many times I wish I could just go and beat the crap out of that bastard manchild Kelliher. I'd surely feel much better, yeah. Fuck him, and the UAC too. \"Eat the rich\" is somehow still relevant, but I really want to popularize \"Beat the rich\".\c-";

"\cfThese cubes are literally an universal safeguard for \"something that no longer exists\". It took me a while to process what that means exactly, but I'll explain. Apparently, there have been cases where pieces of history and reality had to be rewritten. Only gods retain memories of the previous timeline, but everyone else just forgets, and the thing is, this way some things that are forgotten and technically shouldn't exist anymore will stick around, but there has to be a way to \"prevent\" stuff from breaking apart, so this happens. They just turn into that. It's like... you know, when you install a mod in a game, and then you remove it, but there's stuff still in your save that can't be loaded anymore so they just turn into some random fallback thing.

"\cf Portable Rail Gun\c-\n"
"\n"
"Devised as the \"last word\" in weaponry, the \cfSuvan-Kin\c- (\"Grand Lance\" in the \cfXekkas\c- language) is the world's first truly portable rail gun, capable of launching projectiles at speeds of up to 7500km/h (or 14000km/h at full charge). The weapon is powered entirely by a compact quad-cell Korberon-Eneiebium battery pack, easy to replace when needed. The ammunition employed are high-resonant Almasteel spears, capable of piercing cleanly through anything, without even as much as a single dent.\n"
"\n"
"If the piercing potential of these spears isn't destructive enough, a miniature pure-fusion bomb embedded at the head will surely add up even more to that. In the words of the \cfXekkian\c- people: \cf\"The blinding flames of a sacrificed newborn star shall tear asunder all life, rend the soul from its body, and leave no trace whatsoever of those unfortunate to have wronged the wielder of the Grand Lance.\"\c-\n"
"\n"
"\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Single-target firing. The spear will automatically detonate on contact with anything. The area of effect is rather massive, so keep your distance. Due to the resilience of the material used, the spear will not be destroyed, and may potentially ricochet and hit something else.\n"
"\n"
"\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Multi-target firing. The spear is shot at a much higher velocity, and will penetrate multiple targets until finally stopping at something sufficiently solid.\n"
"\n"
"\cfPrimary Reload:\c- Reload the weapon.\n"
"\n"
"\cfSecondary Reload:\c- Swaps the battery. This action can only be performed once the charge is low enough, as it would be wasteful otherwise.\n"
"\n"
"\cfTechniques:\c- The longer you hold secondary fire, the stronger and faster the shot will be. At full charge it may even breach walls.\n"
"\n"
"\cfWarning:\c- Before firing, the rails must extend to their full length. If there are any obstacles in the way that can't be cleared, operation of the weapon is cancelled.\n"

However, while in this weightless state, one may feel disoriented due to the lack of a proper point of reference for where the \"ground\" is, not to mention the difficulty in actually moving around.

It has been often compared to the \cfBag of Holding\c-, as known by many a roleplay enthusiast, and even the head of the company has confirmed that it was indeed the main inspiration for this device.

"How much bullet is too much bullet? The answer, according to \cfCyrus Enterprises\c-, is \"never enough\". The \cfSheen Heavy Machinegun\c- is a monstrosity in all aspects when it comes to delivering lead. Steadily feeding directly off \cfHammerspace™\c-, this puppy can be carried anywhere without the need to bring along hefty ammo boxes, ready to rain death upon anything on demand. Additionally, powered by \cfTach-Engine\c-'s \"Magdalene\" Microfusion battery, the weapon can stay in operation for several days without needing to recharge.\n"
"\n"
"The ammunition employed by this weapon are AP rounds of 14.5x114mm caliber. Unlike the standard heavy ordnance rounds used within the Soviet Union, these are far more potent, employing an alloy of both mundane and exotic elements known as Meta-Tellubrium, generally used for fusion reactor parts due to its outstanding resilience to both extreme pressure and heat. As reported following the \cfGhoul Hunt\c- of 2007, this ammunition is quite effective in tearing through demon flesh as if it were jelly.\n"
"\n"
"While generally meant for mounted use, on-the-go operation is possible, provided the user is equipped with silver-rated power armor at minimum in order to handle its heavy recoil.\n"
"\n"
"\cfPrimary Fire:\c- 1050 RPM operation. Sustained fire in this mode is theoretically endless, as the heat produced can be efficiently nullified by the internal cooling systems, it is therefore the recommended mode for most situations.\n"
"\n"
"\cfSecondary Fire:\c- 2100 RPM operation. Twice the amount of bullet, but with far more heat. Sustained fire in this mode may trigger the weapon's safety lock should the rising heat bring the weapon too close to non-operational temperature.\n"
"\n"
"\cfTertiary Fire:\c- Toggles automated spin, to reduce downtime between bursts. Do note, however, that while this is active, the noise will alert enemies.\n"
"\n"
"\cfReloading:\c- There is absolutely no need whatsoever to reload this weapon, as it feeds directly off Hammerspace, requiring only a large supply of ammunition. Hammerspace containers will automatically link all necessary rounds for tethered feeding.\n"
"\n"
"\cfTechniques:\c- Both triggers can be held simultaneously, allowing for a hybrid two-shot mode, with three times the bullet barrage. The heat output of this mode is quite high, however, so it is not well recommended for extended use.\n"

"\cfHell\c- is a vast world separate from our own, but still contained within our Universe. In its inception, it was known as \cfKur\c-, a peaceful world that the \cfAnarukon\c- people led out of \cfNovoskhana\c- by \cfNoskas Kurenai\c- had sought as the \"promised land\" where they would live in peace away from the tyranny of the \cfEternal Empress\c-. The peace lasted for almost three thousand years, until the \cfBetrayal of Father Nostros\c- happened in 10,675 BC, wherein one of the descendants of the \cfNine Kings\c- of Kur brought with himself a seemingly endless army of creatures who could only be described as \"demons\" and decided to take the whole land for himself and his new \"followers\". Ever since then, the land of Kur has become what can only be described as \"Hell\", under the reign of Nostros as its \"supreme leader\".\n"
"\n"
"In 149, following the disappearance of prince heir \cfManakei\c-, who had been summoned to Earth but never returned, internal conflicts arose within the ranks of Hell's royalty. These fights for the succession of the throne, however, never truly escalated as long as Nostros was there to keep the demons at bay. Many attempts were made to locate the heir and bring him back, unsuccessfully.\n"
"\n"
"In 2145, after the supreme leader of Hell suddenly left the throne for unexplained reasons, leaving only his son, the inexperienced \cfKing Akusei\c- in charge, the various archdemons, corrupt generals of the demon armies, took the chance to stage a coup and overthrow the main royal family, forcing them into exile. This event unfortunately coincided closely with the \cfUAC\c-'s first explorations of Hell. Although curious at first about these odd beings that had entered their realm, they made the decision of exterminating them once they began to show an interest in exploiting their natural resources and in addition had shown hostility when approached. They were almost successful in this, but their plans for sending a full fleet to our own world were swiftly stopped along with their initial invasion of \cfMars City\c-, and couldn't be truly realized until much later, in 2148, when they managed to hijack the UAC's teleporters on Phobos and Deimos, completely overtaking both moon bases and even managing to pull in one of the two moons into their own realm. Following retaliation from a lone soldier, the \cfDoom Marine\c-, they set their sights on Earth, bringing forth all of their legions, under the command of \cfBaramun\c-, the Titan of the East, who was given the title of \cfIcon of Sin\c-.\n"
"\n"
"Against all odds, humanity prevailed, and the invaders were defeated, along with their leader. Despite this major defeat, the demon generals organized several other attacks, using their remaining forces, but failed once more. Having realized that humanity was far more resilient than they could ever have imagined, they gave up. That is, until around August of 2160, when two demonic necromancers, the \cfResurrector Sisters\c-, made their appearance, and brought back to life all those who had fallen, prompting the UAC to recommission their \"problem solver\" once again, who made his way back towards Hell, exterminating the revived demons and swiftly eliminating both of the Resurrector Sisters. Once his initial rampage was over, he sent one final message back to Earth, saying that he had sworn to remain in Hell forever, in order to ensure that the demons would never attempt to attack humanity ever again.\n"
"\n"
"The Doom Marine spent his days fighting the remaining demon armies on Hell, eventually defeating all of the remaining commanders. Seeing that there was no way to stop this lone human's rampage, the archdemon generals devised a plan to instead \"make him leave\". When the marine entered the capital city of \cfDis\c-, with the clear intent to kill them, he fell straight into their trap. \cfErebus\c-, the leading general, took this opportunity to banish him, as far away as he could, far beyond even the outer limits of this Universe, so that he could never have a chance to return.\n"
"\n"
"Despite these massive losses, along with the return of Father Nostros and the unexpected assassination of the archdemon generals, one last threat remains: The hidden schemer \cfAkedas Aximal\c-, former right hand man of Erebus, who now rules over Hell in the shadows. No one has been able to find his true hiding place, and still billions of demons are at his command to prevent the exiled royal family from restoring peace. The only hope left is that of the eventual return of Manakei, who is the only demon strong enough to suppress these innumerable hordes.\n"
"\n"
"\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n"
"\cfOK, first of all, big thanks to Ellen-san's gramps for the info we could get on this. Cytho-sama is like, our only contact with that fucking place, and you won't even believe the things he's told me.\c-\n"
"\n"
"\cfFor example, did you know that not everyone in there is \"the root of all evil\"? Obviously, there's all those bloodthirsty demons that blindly follow the generals and are hellbent (heh) on bringing death and suffering, but... there's also a whole lot of \"civilian\" demons who just want to live in peace over there. People just like Cytho-sama himself, basically. A whole lot of people who are completely in disagreement with all the shit that's going on, but can't really do anything about it.\c-\n"
"\n"
"\cfNow, of course, you may be thinking: \"but aren't all demons supposed to be evil\"? And see, the problem here, is in the naming. Words can really change how you think about stuff and all, yeah. Terms like \"monster\" or \"demon\" make you think of baddies and shit, but what if they aren't? People are all \"oh they're demons, from Hell\", and yeah sure, the first thing that comes to mind is obviously that they're evil because that's what we've all been made to believe. But here's the BIG thing: those are names US humans gave them, immediately after the first contact was made, just because that was the impression everyone got.\c-\n"
"\n"
"\cfThe inhabitants of Kur have a different name for themselves, that has nothing to do with Hell nor demons nor anything, they're the Kuriste, meaning \"forever scorned\". The whole story here is that they were creatures scattered all over the universe that suffered persecution by others for their \"monstrous\" appearance, and this Nostros guy basically decided to travel around the world bringing them all together under his protection.

"\n"
"\cfAnother Update: OK so, you know we met that Nostros guy at the wedding, right? And surely, I did do exactly what I had promised. I kicked him in the gut as hard as I could, over and over until his wife begged me to stop. Yeah, that's the thing, his wife, Azkhan, the \"Matriarch of Hell\". I had a bit of a private chat with her the next day. And she was really happy to hear of my plans. Ye... happy big goat lady. I've been thinking that, if I bring Azkhan with me when I run the search for that prince guy, it might be easier to bring him back. Y'know, maybe he'll answer goatmom's call or something. They never actually bothered to try that in the first place, even though it's like... real obvious.\c-";

"The \cfHellblazer\c- is the third incarnation of the \cfHellfire Cannon\c-, one of the many weapons that \cfImanaki Corp\c- had constructed based on their experiments with harnessing what they called \cfArdent Energy\c-, a power source from the depths of \cfHell\c- itself. It is a direct improvement of the Mark 2 model, the \cfHellrazer\c-, sporting burst-fire capabilities and a simple drum magazine system for easier reloads. It also features many more types of ammunition this time:\n"
"\n"
"\cf\"Blazer\" grenades:\c- The standard ammunition. Highly explosive despite their small size, thanks to the highly condensed Ardent Energy contained within.\n"
"\n"
"\cf\"Crackshot\" cluster grenades:\c- These burst into smaller grenades which will spread on impact, bouncing around for a short time before detonating.\n"
"\n"
"\cf\"Ravager\" incendiary grenades:\c- Ravagers release a wave of unrefined Ardent Energy on detonation, covering a very wide area around themselves. Quite useful in tight spaces, where this scorching hot plasma won't dissipate as quickly, thoroughly roasting any targets within. For safety reasons this ammunition type cannot be employed in burst-fire.\n"
"\n"
"\cf\"Slayer\" warheads:\c- A returning favorite from the previous series. These miniature nukes contain within themselves highly enriched Ardent Energy that will cause total devastation in a large radius, bringing swift death to even the highest ranked demons in Hell's armies. Cannot operate in burst-fire mode either.\n"
"\n"
"The Hellblazer was discontinued following the destruction of the Imanaki Corp headquarters in 2009, but the \cfTach-Engine Technology Institute\c- had managed to reproduce this weapon following their demise. Replicated models do not actually employ this \"Ardent Energy\" however, so they are not as destructive as they were meant to be. Rather, they are powered by the highly volatile \cfNokron\c-, one of the two exotic elements involved in the process of Microfusion, as its potential for use in explosives is quite notable.\n"
"\n"
"Unlike its predecessor, which relied on simple proximity detection, this model can instead interface with targeting arrays in order to provide more precise selective target seeking.\n"
"\n"
"\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Shoots the loaded ammunition with its propulsion armed and ready. Tap to fire one missile, hold to preload up to 2 additional missiles (secondary fire cancels this process). While held, the weapon will pick one target for each loaded missile with each tap of tertiary fire. Tapping reload clears all marked targets.\n"
"\n"
"\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Lobs the loaded ammunition unarmed, as a bouncing grenade. Tap to fire one grenade, hold to preload up to 2 additional grenades (primary Fire cancels this process). Target seeking also affects grenades, as they will attempt to steer themselves towards the target on bounce.\n"
"\n"
"\cfTertiary Fire:\c- Cycles the ammo type for the next reload.\n"
"\n"
"\cfReloading:\c- During a reload, you may either refill the current mag (quite easy through the \cfHammerspace™\c- container), or swap it out for a different ammo type.\n"
"\n"
"\cfTechniques:\c- The grenades will automatically detonate on proximity to any hostile targets (unless explicitly seeking one), so you may still land the shot even if you merely grazed them. It is unclear how exactly they detect the targets, or know that they are hostile.\n"
"\n"
"\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n"
"\cf\"Ardent Energy\"? What's that? Energy extracted from a demon's ass after it ate too much curry? Whatever, anything coming from Hell is best left untouched, y'know. Just look at what happened to the fucking UAC, going around sticking their paws where they shouldn't.\c-\n"
"\n"
"\cfActually, making the replicas use Nokron was a pretty clever thing. I had no idea that shit exploded. Really makes you think about all the safety mechanisms that go into Microfusion engines, definitely justified if THAT can happen.\c-";

"\cfIbuki\c- is the result of the \cfRed Oni\c- supersoldier program, devised by \cfSaya Miyamoto\c- of \cfAkari Labs\c-. The existence of this project was kept completely secret until her public reveal in June of 2077. There was much controversy surrounding the Red Oni program, including Saya's personal involvement in it, having accepted a 40 billion USD payment in exchange for it (which was found to be related to Texas having been sold back to Mexico many weeks before). Despite her clear potential and outstanding combat abilities, she was deployed too late, as only moments later, the \cfWhite Scar\c- happened, and with it, the complete devastation of the \cfUnited States\c-.\n"
"\n"
"Many years after the incident, Ibuki was successfully retrieved from the scorched wastelands, having spent a long time as a sort of \"roaming mercenary\". She returned to Japan in June of 2091, and once settled in, began working odd jobs until finding her true vocation as a nude model.\n"
"\n"
"Having been created from Saya's own DNA, she has effectively inherited the total immortality of the Miyamoto family, on top of this, further enhancements were performed which have given her increased strength and reflexes, along with effectively making her skin bulletproof. Saya has remarked that this last fact means she does not need to wear any clothing.\n"
"\n"
"Additionally citing Saya's rather \"interesting\" decisions, there is the fact of her particular physical traits beyond those of her strength, including her blatantly obscene bust size, which some deem impractical, much to Saya's disagreement.

BUT, I had an idea there. See... I was thirsty as all fuck, and I thought... what if... I made myself a super strong big tiddy gf, right there?\c-\n"
"\n"
"\cfAaaaaand that's exactly what happened. I spent like three years on that whole thing, growing her in a damn tube. It was my first time doing all of that, but I somehow got lucky and it was a big success.

"\n"
"The \cfImanaki Research Corporation\c- was founded in 2004 by \cfTetsuya Imanaki\c-, with its main headquarters in the town of \cfKereshnovka\c-, in northern Siberia.\n"
"\n"
"While they attempted to keep all their work a well-guarded secret, a lot of information would frequently be leaked by anonymous sources. It is well known that Imanaki Corp engaged in interdimensional travel experiments, specifically to the realm of \cfHell\c-. Much was studied of that world, and with the knowledge gained of their research, the corporation would then delve into the combination of Demon and Human technology. It was not known exactly how they got the technology for interdimensional travel in the first place, until documents from the \cfFaculty of Illuminated Nobodies\c- were discovered in late 2099 showing their collaboration, and that most of this technology was of \cfXevetha\c- origin, just like the \cfSUSAN\c- AI.\n"
"\n"
"Following an incident where some of the town's local ghouls attempted to attack the installations, Imanaki Corp contacted the \cfUAAF\c- in order to request armed defense. When the man they sent to negotiate their contract arrived at the town, he was murdered on sight by one of the ghouls. This prompted the UAAF to immediately send soldiers to the area, in order to exterminate those creatures, as it seemed that they maybe were more hostile than they expected. This \"hunt\" for the ghouls started in mid-2007, and lasted for two whole years, as the entirety of the town and its surroundings were thoroughly combed and every single encountered creature was exterminated, except for one.\n"
"\n"
"The very last ghoul they encountered proved to be much more resilient than all the others, taking many lives with it as it caused an immense fire within the Nuskar forest. The locals had warned them that this was no ordinary monster, but something much more powerful that they could never defeat. It took many days to weaken that lone ghoul, and when finally they attempted to go for the killing blow, a man approached the soldiers, and stood between them and the downed beast. He was definitely not one of the locals, and the language he spoke could not be identified by anyone. Despite being ordered to step aside, he did not move, pointing at the soldiers and shouting at them. They eventually decided to open fire on him. This was one of the biggest mistakes humanity would ever make.\n"
"\n"
"That man was none other than \cfPrince Anthon Anderken\c-, one of the most important members of \cfAnarukon\c- royalty, who had, by sheer chance, come to Earth in order to seize that one specific ghoul, for undetermined reasons, at the same exact moment the hunt had started. After being shot down, the ghoul became enraged, and used the last of its strength to engulf everyone in blazing fire. The roar of this explosion of blinding flame was heard all over the world. None of the soldiers survived, as the whole forest was reduced to ashes in an instant. It is unknown what happened to Anthon or the ghoul, but most would assume they both survived.\n"
"\n"
"After this rather spectacular incident, Imanaki Corp resumed their operations, now freed from the threat of the ghouls, although they faced much criticism from the locals for their decision to destroy what they deemed a \"national treasure\". This relative peace would not last long, however, as the consequences of the attack on Anthon would eventually catch up to them. In December of 2009, before yet another routine expedition to Hell, their portals were hijacked by an unidentified attacker, and from them, a swarm of Anarukon soldiers sprung forth, annihilating everyone they'd find within the installations and their surroundings. The Imanaki Corp building was completely destroyed, and the Anarukon forces remained in the town for many days, before eventually returning to their world, satisfied with the destruction they had caused in retaliation.\n"
"\n"

"The Reinforced Combat Hammer is primarily meant to be used in quickly dismantling barricades or tearing down reinforced barriers, but many have taken to more creative uses, such as in the destruction of armored vehicles, or improvised demolition work of whole buildings. It should also be noted that in actual combat it can prove to be very lethal (and bloody) against unarmored targets.\n"
"\n"
"\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Rapid swings, from side to side. Good for quickly plowing through enemy hordes.\n"
"\n"
"\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Hold to ready up a vertical swing, release to let the hammer drop on whatever poor fool is standing in front of you. The longer you hold, the stronger the hit.\n"
"\n"
"\cfTertiary Fire:\c- Hold to ready up a wide horizontal swing, release to perform a potent spin attack, smashing away everything around you. Consecutive presses of tertiary fire while spinning will keep the motion going for longer. Being a combat robot, you should be free from any motion sickness that a human would typically develop while performing this action.\n"

"\n"
"\cfKereshnovka\c- is a small region located somewhere in the north-central bounds of Siberia. A more exact location cannot be properly pinpointed, as it appears to exist within some sort of isolated pocket of space that defies the laws of space-time. The region is home to the namesake town of Kereshnovka, which is inhabited almost entirely by members of the \cfQurensniv\c- race who, in 130 BC, had fled their home planet, escaping persecution from mad dictator king \cfMarc P. Karnanaiahmani\c-, by then leader of the entire planet of \cfKarnanaiahma\c-, in the neighboring \cfXathar system\c-. Since its foundation, \cfReubens C. Karnanaiahmani\c-, second son of said king and organizer of this mass exodus, has acted as mayor of the town.\n"
"\n"
"The town of Kereshnovka is surrounded by various out-of-place landmarks that make it even more difficult to truly deduce its location. It is delimited by sea at the north, and the closest land to it is the small island of Kopo (\"Midnight\" in Qurensniv). Extending from the east and south is the large Nuskar forest, which is off limits to foreigners due to the \"ghouls\" that inhabit it and prey upon those not native to the region. To the west, past a rather sizable mountain ridge, is the Bakie village, a small rural settlement, and to the south/southwest, the arid Yakendere desert.\n"
"\n"
"The town has been host to numerous odd incidents, starting from the \cfGreat Fire of Kereshnovka\c- in the year 149, when a Qurensniv druid by the name of \cfDaos Khomax\c- summoned a large demon into the town that proceeded to burn it all down. Most people thankfully survived, and the demon fled after the local defense forces arrived. The mad druid was executed, but not before claiming that he would return, for he had \"bound his immortal soul to the great forest spirits\". Days after his burial, his grave was found empty, and ever since then some of the locals have reported seeing a strange hooded figure roam the forests, assuming it to be the late druid, now having become one of the many ghouls.\n"
"\n"
"Other events, in chronological order, include:\n"
"\n"
"\cfThe Killings of \"Hynnykka the Great Witch\" (1731):\c- A series of gruesome murders across the town, perpetrated by a self-proclaimed \"great witch\". The culprit always left her signature at the crime scene, along with a hint for the \"next target\". Despite many attempts, she was never caught. In some cases, the murders would still happen despite all attempts at protecting the target. At the last of the murder scenes, the note she left contained only four words: \"now everyone will die\". However, nothing happened afterwards.\n"
"\n"
"\cfThe \"Spectral Shockwave\" (1987):\c- As described by eyewitnesses, a large explosion of teal fire emanating from the abandoned oil rig that \cfDr. Häzel Hoodth\c- had been using as his personal laboratory. His body was never found, so he was assumed dead. It was reported however that the flames that burst from the location had an odd form reminiscent of the man himself. Much later, others reported seeing a strange \"specter\" blinking around random locations across the Nuskar forest, also bearing the same resemblance to the late doctor.\n"
"\n"
"\cfThe Onoke Mansion Murders (2003):\c- A large fire breaks out at the \cfOnoke Mansion\c-, where the \cfOnoke\c- and \cfImanaki\c- families were currently reunited to celebrate the union of two of their members. All were found brutally murdered, in some odd ritual manner. The only survivor of this whole incident was \cfTetsuya Imanaki\c-, who decided not to attend citing important work reasons.\n"
"\n"
"\cfThe Ghoul Hunt (2007):\c- After a high ranking member of the \cfUAAF\c- was murdered by one of the local ghouls following a business visit to the \cfImanaki Corp\c- headquarters, a hunt immediately began for the creatures, despite the cries of \"destroying national treasures\" from the locals. This hunt lasted for two years, and crowned into the reappearance of the demon that had caused the great fire of 149, who, this time, set ablaze the entire Nuskar forest after being cornered by UAAF soldiers. Following that, all the ghouls were gone, along with the demon itself.\n"
"\n"
"\cfThe Hellbound Incident (2009):\c- During a routine teleportation experiment at Imanaki Corp, their systems were hijacked by an unknown attacker, which altered the destination of their portals. Following this, an army of \cfAnarukon\c- warriors went on a rampage all around the facility, eliminating every single Imanaki employee along with all UAAF soldiers placed there in charge of defense. Afterwards, the entire building was destroyed, and the warriors remained there for several days, attacking anyone that approached, until mayor \cfReubens C. Karnanaiahmani\c- managed to contact their leader and request them to leave, as \"enough human blood has been shed already\".\n"
"\n"
"\cfSUSAN (2018-2021, 2097-2099):\c- In the winter of 2018, a gigantic structure rose from the seas near the town, and began broadcasting a message of \"world purification\": It announced itself to be \cfSUSAN\c-, the \cfSpear of Unmaking, Severance, Annihilation and Nullification\c-, created to rid the world of all humans in order to purify it. Following this announcement, Russia's nuclear missile systems were hijacked by it, and it began to emit a countdown of three years until this \"purification\". This would eventually be stopped in 2021 following the \cfLuna Event\c-. SUSAN was successfully neutralized, but could still not be destroyed. It remained inactive until 2097, when it was reactivated again by its very creator, an alien entity called \cfUruk'Anth\c-. This time, the countdown was of two years. Without anyone to stop it this time, all hope was lost, but somehow, in the last minute, something failed, and SUSAN self-destructed, taking the life of its creator with it in the process.\n"

"\cf @kiririn_xanai\c-\n"
"\n"
"Born in 2080 to \cfSyrakha Yanikov\c- and \cfAzya Xanai\c-, \cfKirin\c- became the emperor of \cfAkkou\c- at the young age of 12, having shown great interest in following the steps of his mother.\n"
"\n"
"Despite having the title of \"Emperor\", he actually holds no real power over the people of Akkou, and instead acts more like a political and economical advisor. As a matter of fact, the \cfSykhai Empire\c- couldn't be described as an empire either. Most would describe it as something closer to a collection of anarchist communes than anything else, unlike the actual, tyrannical \cfEmpire of Novoskhana\c- that they had seceded from.\n"
"\n"
"For almost 80 whole years as the leader of Akkou, Kirin had remained single, as no one dared to approach him with the intention of marrying, for he was revered as an icon of \"untarnished purity\", in part due to his own name, Kirin, meaning \"innocence\" in the \cfAnarukon\c- language. It wasn't until a chance meeting with \cfSaya Miyamoto\c- in 2171 that this eventually changed. After a rather busy month, in which the young emperor additionally came to meet Saya's other partners, love bloomed, eventually culminating in a collective marriage (\cg♥\c-) in May 8th of 2171, with their union marking the beginning of a great alliance between mankind and the Anarukon, additionally helping heal the old wounds of the \cfHellbound Incident\c-, as this alliance extended to the \cfKurenai Kingdom\c- too, through the shared friendship with \cfQueen Andreki Anderken\c-.\n"
"\n"
"Kirin himself can be described as a rather \"down to earth\" leader. Being quite close to the people of Akkou, and fond of making friends. He is also absolutely adorable. When not attending his duties as advisor of the people, Kirin engages in many of his hobbies, such as painting (being quite skilled at drawing portraits, for example), or the practice of magic alongside his mother. He is also quite fond of videogames, anime, and many other forms of modern entertainment, and is often seen talking extensively on social media about the subject, happily introducing the people of Earth to popular games and shows from his homeworld.\n"

As the two grew closer, she would eventually be struck by the most unexpected of revelations: He was none other than the emperor of the land himself! Kind, caring, pure-hearted and innocent, he was a polar opposite of her, but despite their differences, the love they felt for each other would only grow stronger. One day, having been invited to the imperial palace, Alissa would bear witness to a side of the emperor he had never shown anyone before. And thus, her new life began.\n"

"Released in 2020 to critical acclaim, \cfLove Signals\c- is the debut album of AI idol \cfMeidobot\c-, created in 2017 by \cfAkari Labs\c-. It's been described as a \"declaration of love\" from the idol to her creator, \cfSaya Miyamoto\c-.\n"
"\n"
"\cfTrack Listing:\c-\n"
"  1. A Song From the Heart\n"
"  2. Synthetic Romance\n"

"  4. Do Robots Dream of Electric Love\n"
"  5. Algorithm of Desire\n"
"  6. Compile my Feelings\n"
"  7. Love Signals\n"
"\n"
"The album is a collaborative effort between Meidobot herself and the various independent artists that have made their fame composing melodies for her to sing to. Its beginning track, the unfairly sweet \cfA Song From the Heart\c-, remained at the top of several rankings for many years since its release, gaining even more fame after it was revisited in Meidobot's fifth album, \cfLove, Robots, and Everything Between\c- (2043), with \cfAshley Knox\c- of the British band \cfBlack Rat's Coven\c- singing alongside her.\n"

"\cfMeido-chan~\c- \cg♥\c-\n"
"\n"
"\cfIt's so good, her singing voice... Getting her into this whole thing, of being an idol, one of my best ideas ever. Even if J-Pop isn't 100% my kinda thing, I still love it because it's her, and I love her, so much...\c-\n"
"\n"
"\cfHeh, did you know that when we were first dating she would sometimes personally serenade me? God, that was so cliched, but I loved it. Wish she'd still do that, but she's not really into singing anymore ever since she retired, long before you were born. Maybe if the two of us get together for this we could convince her, wouldn't you think?\c-";

"During the final days of the \cfSUSAN\c- rogue AI incident, when all hope was lost for mankind's survival, one very unexpected event happened. An emergency message was sent from the Moon, overtaking all video and radio signals. It was the announcement of an alien species making their presence known. The full transcript is as follows:\n"
"\n"
"\cf\"This is a message for all of humankind. We are the Nukuri. For thousands of years we have observed you, studied you, while in hiding. We were to ensure absolute secrecy, and avoid influencing your developments in any way, until the time was right for our first contact. However, the current circumstances call for this contact to happen much sooner than we had planned. Your world is in immediate danger of ultimate destruction, and we shall not stand still and watch. Do not fear, the threat will be dealt with soon. May the stars shine bright on you.\"\c-\n"
"\n"
"Following the announcement, SUSAN's countdown to destruction was halted, and control of Russia's missile systems was reestablished. The \cfNukuri\c- had somehow remotely neutralized the AI at its core, as nothing could truly be observed by the units stationed right outside the range of its self-defense systems, the whole structure simply shut itself down.\n"
"\n"
"Shortly after, and over many days, regular communications with the Nukuri would happen. Many questions would be answered, such as their origins (a remote solar system called \cfXathar\c-, located in the Andromeda galaxy), how long had they been studying us (since 1309 BC), and if they were peaceful (to this last one, there was a long pause before getting a simple \"yes\", which raised some concerns).\n"
"\n"
"On May 11th of 2021, an alliance between humans and Nukuri was finally signed, after the first reunion of \cfEmperor Ledora Yathai\c- with the leaders of the major nations of Earth. By the end of the year, many among the Nukuri had already made themselves at home in our planet, most coming from the \cfLuna Research Institute for Human Studies\c-, who desired to have a more in-depth experience of our culture.\n"
"\n"
"In addition, the alliance provided humanity with a major boost in technological development, thanks to their various advances and knowledge being made available to us. Among other things, the Nukuri put a lot of effort into making their own computer technology compatible with ours, resulting in the powerful \cfNekern Architecture\c-. They also helped alleviate the struggles for clean energy by introducing us to the \cfNokorokinylum Microfusion Engine\c-, a method of cold fusion requiring little space and equipment, but also rather exotic elements (which are thankfully easily available in their homeworld).\n"
"\n"
"These major changes also brought the attention of other species, neighbors of the Nukuri, who also showed interest in us. Humanity was made aware of just how, despite the vast emptiness of it all, the universe has much more life in it that one could have imagined. Plans had been made, for Earth to become part of the so-called \cfX'Animen Coalition\c-, an interplanetary association the Nukuri were part of.\n"
"\n"
"However, it all came to a sudden end when, in June of 2073, \cfWorld War 3\c- began. In a single year, our alliance, all the great advancements, everything was completely undone, in what is often cited as the biggest mistake in human history: \cfThe White Scar\c-.\n"
"\n"
"\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n"
"\cfEveryone really thought it was all over by then. Even us, with our damn anti-apocalypse bunker of a house. There was no way that we'd survive what that thing was going to do, practically setting off all the fucking nukes it could reach at once. And then THAT happened, kind of cliched af to be done right at the very last moment, a fucking heroic save like that. Bet they did it on purpose to look cool, heh.\c-\n"
"\n"
"\cfAnyway, life was good back then, with all those Nukuri cuties hanging out with us. You could see so many of them in the street, and well, that was also when I met Zana-sama too, best goddamn Christmas gift of my life, heh. Really REALLY miss those days, you know, pretty much hanging out with her every weekend or so. Nowadays, life just plain sucks, and I can only ever get the chance to like, send and get messages super-rarely by passing them through the Lunar Embassy (when those stupid-ass rabbits actually do their jobs).\c-\n"
"\n"
"\cfI really wish things would go back to how they used to be. I mean, sure, since our country didn't sign the bullshit White Scar treaty we can still use their tech, but they can't come here themselves, nor are we allowed to go there either. Fuck all that shit.\c-";

Much later, and with Zanaveth's assistance, Saya would begin the creation of more maidbots, wishing for the whole world to be able to have a Maidbot of their own. An adoption service was set up in 2023, where maidbots, who'd be raised and prepared at Akari Labs, would hold interviews with potential adopters, allowing them to have the final choice on who to live with.

"The \cfManarock\c- (Adkana: Manarokou, lit.: \"shielded heart fruit\") is a fruit common within the \cfUusnai\c- region of the divine realm of \cfKurain\c-. Known for its fragrant scent and creamy, soft core, it's considered a delicacy among \cfGods\c-. It is also well known that, if not properly and cleanly removed from its hard outer shell, it can become lethally poisonous, causing rapid death on lesser beings through spread of a very potent neurotoxin.\n"
"\n"
"It rarely, if ever, has made any appearances in our own world. Some gods may bring them along, but they can only grow in the soil of the divine realm.

"\cf*sigh* Maruku offered me one once. And like the dumb idiot I was I bit straight in, shell and all. Of course, I fucking died.

They're really tasty when they don't kill you instantly. The taste... I don't know how to describe it, it's sweet, somewhat lemony, but like with all sourness removed, and it melts in the mouth. Feels like custard, kinda.\c-\n"
"\n"
"\cfYou know, actually, this felt to me like the complete opposite of when I tried pufferfish. Like... I feel it's totally overrated.

"\n"
"Though it is not generally a problem for the native \cfAnarukon\c-, the obscene sugar content of these has proven to be dangerous to mortals unless consumed in moderation, potentially resulting in the development of cardiovascular diseases or even death.\n"

"The \cfSparkster\c- began as an attempt by \cfTach-Engine Technologies\c- to replicate the energy weapons of the defunct \cfDecade Mechanics\c-. The first two prototypes were a failure, as it was seen that there was no way to create anything even remotely resembling Biosparks, a semi-sentient form of energy ammunition.\n"
"\n"
"Then, a breakthrough came: Why try to copy something that can't ever be truly understood? Why not keep the same internal principles of the weapon but employ different, easily obtainable ammunition? And thus, the \"modern\" Sparkster lineup was born. Employing high-density \cfNokron\c- and \cfKinylum\c- plasma charges, the x3 series can reach the same destructive potential as heavy artillery, with lesser weight, size, and hassle of operation.\n"
"\n"
"\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Hold to charge a glob of Kinylum plasma, release to let it out into the world. The destructive potential is relatively small, but has a notable lingering burn both across the path it takes, and in a dense cloud where it impacted.\n"
"\n"
"\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Hold to charge a glob of Nokron plasma, release to let it out into the world. While more immediately destructive than the primary ammunition, this one is less stable, and tends to come out as a searing blast, rather than a projectile.\n"
"\n"
"\cfPrimary Reload:\c- Load in a Kinylum cell. Up to 3 can be held in reserve.\n"
"\n"
"\cfSecondary Reload:\c- Load in a Nokron cell. Same reserve capacity.\n"
"\n"
"\cfTechniques:\c- Projectile charge can be held indefinitely, as the weapon will vent regularly to stabilize the weapon's peak ignition potency. This could allow one to simply charge from cover and pop out to release the shot when needed. Additionally, the possibility to press both triggers at once is also documented, which allows for a potent release of Nokorokinylum plasma, comparable to a miniature nuke in destructive potential. It is not recommended to perform a combined attack unless the target is far away enough so as to not endanger the user.\n"

Very few survived, who still live to this day, and witness accounts are rather bare.\n"
"\n"
"In 2005, an expedition by \cfDevanikan\c- adventurers resulted in the discovery of several artifacts at the very bottom of this crater. These were the so-called \cfArtifacts of Nedoshiaan\c-, a set of weapons devised by the dictator god himself and created by his loyal engineer \cfNukurines Mei Mess\c-, who among others had all survived this incident and no longer wished to associate themselves with it. These artifacts were immediately put under the protection of the \cfUnissix Clan\c-, and to this day they tightly control any research and reproduction of them.\n"
"\n"
"Only four artifacts were found, of the five that had been allegedly constructed. It's widely accepted that this fifth artifact was the one responsible for the death of the deity, and had been lost in the process. The known artifacts are as follows:\n"
"\n"
"\cfMykradvo:\c- Also known as the \cfGreat Anomaly\c-, an orb of pure energy that, in the hands of a single individual, would allow them to smite all around them in an instant. Its power is, however, very limited, and a great deal of time is needed for it to recharge itself after use, making it more of a last resort weapon for emergencies.\n"
"\n"
"\cfKyshyje:\c- The \cfAmulet of Misfortune\c- that, when worn by an individual, would bring absolute destruction and madness to all those who desired to harm them. At least, that's what it was meant to do, as once tested, it appeared to instead attract misfortune to whoever wore it, perhaps as a sign of them not being \"worthy\" of wearing it, as some theorized.\n"
"\n"
"\cfYnykron:\c- Known by most as the \cfDeath Cannon\c-. One of two surviving artifacts that could be counted as an actual, physical weapon. Fueled by the \"essence of countless tortured souls\", it is capable of channeling it all into an unstoppable beam of energy that tears through space-time, erasing from existence anything it comes in contact with.\n"
"\n"
"\cfNekrodero:\c- One artifact that has been forbidden from ever being used, due to the very nature of its operation, and the effects it has on those who are struck by it. Details on what exactly it does are impossible to obtain, but it has been described as \"the most abhorrent display of cruelty that not even the most twisted of minds could have imagined\".\n"
"\n"
"\cfInshtrometanykha:\c- The fifth and missing artifact, the \cfGod Slayer\c-. Named this due to the fact this was the only known weapon that could actually destroy a god across the three layers of existence. Its effectiveness is very clear, taking into account what happened. Only two deities survived the blast, having been just grazed by it, however one became unable to take on a physical form, requiring an artificial body, and the other suffered severe damages that have put them in a \"deep sleep\".\n"
"\n"
"Of these artifacts, the \cfYnykron\c- was successfully reproduced and re-engineered for more \"mundane\" use, after \cfMisa Unissix\c- obtained its original blueprints from Mei Mess himself. Its usage still is very strictly controlled, of course.\n"

"\cfNekuratek\c- was founded by \cfZanata Nekuraku I\c- in 1744, initially under the name of \cfNekuraku Rafana Sakosai (Nekuraku Arms Manufactory)\c-. It quickly became the main provider of weaponry for the \cfYathai Empire\c-, which secured the Nekuraku family's position among the \"high class\" citizens of the Empire. With this new status, Zanata even managed to secure a position as provincial leader of Akai, one of the largest and richest in \cfNahkami\c-. With this absolute dominion of that region, Nekuratek would extend itself with practically no limits, thus becoming the largest corporation on the planet.\n"
"\n"
"Zanata remained at the head of the company until 1870, after a malfunction in Nekuratek's first \cfNokorokinylum Fusion Reactor\c- prototype resulted in an explosion that took her life and those of several other workers. Following the suicide of Zanata's husband, and with their two children, \cfDokuro\c- and \cfNokoi\c-, showing no interest in the family business, the only potential successor that remained was her granddaughter, \cfZanata II\c-.\n"
"\n"
"Once in charge of Nekuratek, Zanata II began to diversify into other fields, such as robotics and information technology, and gradually cut down on the fabrication of weaponry. It was not clear at first, the reason for this sudden change in direction, but following the fall of the Yathai Empire, she eventually revealed her long time disdain for the tyrannical regime, and her wish to distance herself and her family from \"being architects of death\".\n"
"\n"
"During the initial period of \"deescalation\", her son \cfZanaveth I\c- had been in charge of the arms manufacturing division, and was responsible for the creation of \cfThe Emperor's Wrath\c-, a low orbit weapon that would be used in the events of the \cfWhite Scar\c- incident. After having witnessed what his creation had done, he resigned from his position and spent several years in solitude. He never involved himself with the company ever since.\n"
"\n"
"During the massive overhaul to the political and economic systems of the nation in the period of transition of 2104-2108, Nekuratek was one of the very first to reform itself into a publicly owned organization, with the Nekuraku family serving merely as \"symbolic leaders\". In 2128, Zanata II retired and left \cfZanaveth II\c- in charge of the company.\n"
"\n"
"\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n"
"\cfGreat people to work with (even back during their old \"unchecked capitalism\" phase), tbh. I didn't actually have much of a contact with the old \"big boss\", but Zana-sama was always there anyway, and it was real nice to talk to her, even about boring business stuff.\c-\n"

I don't know how Zanata-sama even managed to do all that right under the noses of those bastards. She was sooooo obviously anti-empire you'd have to be fucking blind to not realize. And she did have a GOOD reason to be, too, losing family in the war and whatnot.\c-\n"

This rather peculiar place of study is world renown for being host to all sorts of exotic courses, some even promising to provide students with hidden knowledge that no other institution in the entire universe could be capable of delivering.\n"
"\n"
"Being part of the Mishe, the two brothers have what can only be described as \"reality manipulation\" powers. This has only been witnessed on rare occasions, however, such as during the final moments of the \cfNukuri Seventh World War\c-, where one of them managed to singlehandedly put a stop to the conflict, shrugging off the attacks of imperial soldiers while making his way to the throne, whereupon reaching it, he punched emperor \cfLedora Yathai\c- off his seat, launching him across the room in a perfectly straight line towards the nearest window, and sending him off into low orbit.

"\cfPancake Engineering:\c- An oddly-named course on the principles of the three layers of reality and their interactions, along with methods for \"bending them to your will\". This course has one of the highest dropout rates, as most students are driven to insanity during the first few years.\n"
"\n"
"\cfFoundations of Astronomic Engineering:\c- A course on the basics of creating whole planets from scratch. Also covers some topics of bioengineering. This one is generally only open to deities, or other species capable of such an act.\n"
"\n"
"\cfEssential History:\c- Recommended to anyone seeking to know every last detail of the universe's growth and evolution, although it's best to be from a species that lives long enough to be capable of surviving this 730 year long course. The brothers have said that this is all that's needed to cover \"the essentials\" of history, though.\n"

Of all the various laws that have come from them, many have become so controversial that it has resulted in large groups of people \"splitting off\" from the empire to form their own separate nations. The Empress's eldest granddaughter, Executioner Eryukha Yanikov, personally directs (and often herself delivers) all punishment of citizens that are deemed \cf\"Deviants\"\c-, a term used for all those who do not obey the empire's laws.\n"

"There are countless ways one could be labeled an \"enemy of the state\", among them, showing signs of \"destabilizing the natural order of society\", which includes but is not limited to: Men who reject marriage or having children, men who father another man as their first child, or are incapable of having any descendants, men who are witnessed maintaining relationships with other men, any individual who shares a name with the empress, any individual who \"lives in disconnect from society\" (usually used to refer to those who remain unemployed for extended periods of time, or who lack a home), women who do not contribute to war efforts, women who are seen maintaining relationships with other women, \"divergent\" individuals (term used for those that don't fall under the male/female binary), etc.\n"
"\n"
"Two of the major bodies that split from the Empire are the \cfKurenai Kingdom\c-, initially founded by the \cfVexx Sisterhood\c- as a safe haven for enemies of the state, and the \cfSykhai Empire\c-, an ironically named anarcho-communist collective founded by a branch of the Yanikov family that disagreed strongly with the \"broken system\" of the Empire. A large part of the free \cfAnarukon\c- population in the multiverse is contained in these two, while the rest have settled in various other places, including Earth.\n"

The empress may have BEEN evil in the past, but she sure did go through a redemption arc from what we learned back at the wedding (even though she's still somewhat icky).

"These so-called \cfHealth and Armor Nuggets\c- are small chunks of indeterminate composition that were found in large amounts within a cave system below the ancient alien ruins discovered in Sedna during an expedition by the \cfTach-Engine Technology Institute\c-. It appears that, when held tightly in one's grasp, the glowing substance within \"melts\" into the body, and either heals one's wounds or strengthens their natural resistances. These effects hence resulting in their naming of \"Health\" and \"Armor\" nuggets.\n"
"\n"
"Despite many extensive studies performed, no negative side effects have been observed, nor does it seem that there are any risks from excessive usage. One positive side effect, however, is well known, one arising from the \"overload\" of Armor Nuggets, wherein they will also have an immediate healing effect upon being harmed, as their effects gradually wear off with each hit.\n"

"\n"
"The \cfNukuri\c- are a pale-skinned humanoid race native to \cfHebeku\c-'s frozen moon of \cfNahkami\c-, in the \cfXathar System\c- (part of the \cfX'Animen Coalition\c-). They are among the most technologically advanced within the entire Coalition, and are seen as a shining example of progress and dedication, although they've had an extensive history of war and conflict, along with having been involved in notable atrocities. Such a dark past is something they are well aware and ashamed of, ever since the end of their seventh world war and the massive political and economic reform they underwent afterwards.\n"
"\n"
"In the past, Nahkami was a ruthless warmongering empire ruled with an iron fist by the \cfYathai\c- royal family. However, following the reform, and with emperor \cfLedora Yathai\c- being \"forced into exile\" by the founders of the \cfUniversity of Nos-Kora\c-, who led said reform, the \cfNukuri Unified Government\c- was created, with \cfZanata Nekuraku II\c- personally appointed as \"transitional\" prime minister.\n"
"\n"
"As someone who had suffered the loss of her mother and her husband in the previous wars, Zanata had always been opposed to the empire and its practices, including their decision to attack humanity at the peak of WW7, in what was known as the \cfWhite Scar\c- incident. Following the establishment of the new government, she attempted to make amends with us, but nothing came of it. After this had happened, she stepped down both from her position as prime minister, and also as leader of \cfNekuratek\c-, the company her family has run for many generations. As of this article's writing, the current prime minister of Nahkami, elected by the vast majority, is \cfSaya Kowayanau\c-, who is also the governor of the province of \cfSaya\c-.\n"
"\n"
"The Nukuri Unified Government can be seen as one of the various examples of successful transitions away from dictatorial regimes to something more open. Its form of government is self-described as a \"communist omnicracy\", where everyone stands in equal terms and no voice is left unheard. Its method of allowing all its inhabitants to take part in decision-making, the \"fractal vote\", was widely praised by other neighboring nations. In a way, everything is ultimately decided by all people within the nation, no voice is left unheard. In terms of its economy, there are no concepts of currency, or private ownership. All previous businesses are now publicly owned, however with their founders still holding what's basically a \"symbolic\" position of leadership, being still involved in their management, under government supervision.\n"
"\n"
"It's also well known that the Nukuri still possess a very strong military force, but they only serve to defend the nation from external threats (something that has rarely happened). In addition, the manufacture and use of weapons is heavily supervised, too.\n"
"\n"
"As of 2148, Nahkami is divided in 17 provinces: Vutai (current capital), Akai, Renko, Namonai, Kobei, Vuzena, Denkou, Kunei, Saya, Vikou, Okuu, Keshou, Nomio, Esevei, Dokaku, Osaka and Asau. There are also two major \"off-world\" settlements, the space station of Toku and the \cfLuna Research Institute\c- on Earth's moon. It should be noted that since the signing of the \cfWhite Scar Treaty\c-, the Luna Institute has remained closed, however.\n"

"\cfNuutek\c- was founded by \cfAranai Raikishionen\c- in 1945 BC, as a company dedicated to constructing weaponry for the \cfYathai Empire\c-. They were pioneers in the introduction of \"futuristic\" alternatives to military technology of the era. Specifically, their research in weaponizing plasma. Not much changed for them in a long time, staying in the lead of the market for centuries, always innovating, thinking bigger, feeding more into the endless wars that ravaged \cfNahkami\c-, hoping that one day the vile empire that had overthrown the Raikishionen family would be destroyed by the weapons they had created.\n"
"\n"
"Things changed in 1744, with the fledgling \cfNekuratek\c- entering the scene, and quickly becoming their main competitor. The two companies raced to surpass one another, but soon enough they were defeated, Nekuratek had become the empire's favorite, and through this grew so fast it was now impossible to beat. In an interview, \cfRaik L Raikishionen\c-, CEO at the time, admitted his company's defeat, stating that \cf\"their plans are far more devious than we could ever imagine, they deserve to lead us into a new era\"\c-. Interpretations of this statement vary, but following the fall of the empire in 2104, it was made clear that they too knew of Nekuratek's final goal.\n"
"\n"
"Since then, the company has shifted their efforts to the manufacture of electronic components, many of which are used in products developed by Nekuratek. Their former weapon tech is discontinued, but it has all been open sourced and anyone with the right materials can build them if they want.\n"

"In October of 2003, a fire broke out in the \cfOnoke Mansion\c-, at the outskirts of \cfKereshnovka\c-, during a meeting between the \cfImanaki\c- and \cfOnoke\c- families. When the firefighters arrived, they found everyone dead, all having been murdered in increasingly gruesome ways. The culprit was never found.\n"
"\n"
"There are many theories about what could have happened. Most point towards this having been the work of \cfHynnykka the Great Witch\c-, a serial killer from centuries ago (or a possible successor), remarking on the fact that her last note could have the potential interpretation of having been directed towards these two powerful families (\"everyone will die\"). This is not only seen as a considerable stretch, but there are clear doubts that something like this could have been done by a single individual.\n"
"\n"
"Another theory points to ritual suicide, though there would be no clear explanation for why such a thing would be done in the first place. Both families were in quite good standing, and this reunion had been in celebration of the marriage between two of their members, marking the start of a very beneficial partnership.\n"
"\n"
"Many other theories, each increasingly wilder and crazier than the last, mention possibilities such as attacks by cultists, the town's ghouls, or some sort of clearly planned assassination by rival families (of which none are actually known).\n"
"\n"
"To this day, no one knows exactly what had happened then, and the case remains unsolved. Only one person survived this, \cfTetsuya Imanaki\c-, CEO of \cfImanaki Corp\c-, but solely because he had been absent from the event.\n"

"\cf Igneous Projectile Launcher\c-\n"
"\n"
"A powerful incendiary weapon coming from \cfKmonn Shuna\c-, prized among \cfXekkian\c- commanders. The \cfQuadravol\c- shoots blazing balls of fire that explode spectacularly in contact with anything, releasing intense heat and kinetic force. It is seen to be very useful against crowds as the force of impact is potent enough to disperse them quickly. One very distinctive trait of the weapon is the fact that the flames that burst out of it will burn brightly even underwater.\n"
"\n"
"The name of the weapon comes from the \cfXekkas\c- language, and it stands for \cf\"Ardent Cross\"\c-. This name is taken from a verse of the old legend of the heroic general \cfAntikalapsus\c-, who in 17381 BC defeated the \cfInshta Ereuma\c- and his \cfMinistry of Destruction\c-. As the verse narrates:\n"
"\n"
"\cf\"Saida shuna hoskaxar ter quadravol sundara vostoshakera serai, doro ultirukoda bos naaxakka ter usosmodu bura tasaskil.\"\c-\n"
"\n"
"\cf(For the flames of the ardent cross spread throughout the horde, and cleansed this holy land of the corruption they had brought.)\c-\n"
"\n"
"The Ardent Cross was the name of the general's sword which, when imbued with magic, would release deadly cross slashes of burning flame.\n"
"\n"
"\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Single, large fireball shot. Very minor drift, so its effective range is quite long. Ignites nearby targets on impact.\n"
"\n"
"\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Scatter shot of lesser fireballs. Increased drift and lower effective range, but very useful against multiple targets.\n"
"\n"
"\cfTertiary Fire:\c- Pumps additional fuel, increasing the strength of your shots, but also their drift, making them less accurate. Excess overcharge will result in a wildly inaccurate misfire, but even this has its uses. Forcibly pumping in the middle of primary or secondary fire engages slamfire, allowing you to shoot rapid low-charge bursts.\n"
"\n"
"\cfReloading:\c- Each fuel box allows for ten shots (less if boosted), after which it must be reloaded. The weapon firmly locks the box in place until it's fully depleted, however.\n"
"\n"
"\cfTechniques:\c- The weapon has a certain \"extra effective\" special move should you be close enough to your target. Plunging the four bayonets into an enemy and immediately pulling the trigger afterwards will result in a potent point blank explosion that will send them flying, covered in flames.\n"

"Devised by a reportedly \"insane\" and \"derranged\" engineer at \cfNekuratek\c-'s Advanced Arms Division, this weapon's development was cut short of its initial ambitious plans. Citing that this engineer whose name won't be revealed \"played too many videogames\", he was stopped before he could add a whopping 15 different modes of operation to the weapon, rendering it extremely convoluted, costly and \"completely ridiculous\".\n"
"\n"
"The \cfRafan-Kos\c- project (\"Ultimate Weapon\" in Nukuribaku) would only be partially completed once chief engineer \cfZanaveth Nekuraku I\c- personally stepped in to ask for this \"inanity\" to cease.

"\n"
"The weapon employs \cfKabbadon\c- as fuel, a common byproduct of \cfNokorokinylum\c- fusion, thus making it fairly easy to produce. However, the density and degree of purity required in the creation of a single fuel pod make its price escalate dramatically.\n"
"\n"

"Ever since its creation by \cfProfessor Eushura Kmonn Jr.\c-, the \cfRay-Khom\c- has taken a permanent spot in every \cfXekkian\c- soldier's loadout. Reliable, efficient, needing little to no maintenance due to lacking any moving parts beyond its feeding mechanism. Ammunition is additionally quite easy to come by, at least locally, as exports carry with them heavy taxing.\n"
"\n"
"The weapon is powered entirely by a compact quad-cell Korberon-Eneiebium battery pack, easy to replace when needed. Ammunition is fed from 20-round magazines. The ammunition itself, slim 40mm caseless magnetized bolts, fitted with a hyperdense Dyratin ignition charge, releasing potent discharges of ultra-high temperature plasma on impact, capable of melting quickly through anything short of high resonant Almasteel plating and causing strong, stinging burns to Xekkian skin (or severe corrosion of muscle and bone tissue to anything weaker).\n"
"\n"
"\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Steady shooting, quick and precise. Minimal recoil due to the electromagnetic operation, mostly quiet as the projectiles are shot ever so slightly below the speed of sound. Your enemies are guaranteed to not take notice of your attacks until it's too late.\n"
"\n"
"\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Engages the concentrated pulse emitters along the weapon's blades, emitting a potent discharge of electricity in front of the user, temporarily stunning anything that stands too close. May cause death on weak targets. It is recommended to only use this sparingly, as it drains the battery quickly.\n"
"\n"
"\cfPrimary Reload:\c- Reloads the weapon.\n"

"\cfSecondary Reload:\c- Swaps the battery. This action can only be performed once the charge is low enough, as it would be wasteful otherwise.\n"

The specific shape of the relics, that of the Egyptian Ankh, symbol of life, came as a revelation to the founder of the \cfTach-Engine Technology Institute\c-, who led this expedition. He theorized that these ruins might have been part of a \"staging area\" that his ancestors could have used when they first came to Earth, to found their colony in Egypt.\n"

"This specific artifact, called \cfRefresher\c-, has strong rejuvenating effects, much more potent than those of other similar healing devices previously discovered. Any wounds or afflictions are instantly healed once the artifact is held tightly against someone's chest. Like with the others, the nature of these effects is entirely unknown, and \cfJ.A. Tachmek-Smith\c- himself has dedicated most of his time to research.\n"

"\cfRyuji\c- was born in \cfGensokyo\c- in 1956, spending most of his life within the \cfHuman Village\c-, the only one settlement within the region inhabited entirely by humans, rather than Youkai. During his early teens, he became quite rebellious, desiring to leave the village and have \"adventures\". One day, he fled, and got himself lost in the bamboo forest surrounding \cfEientei\c-. There, he came across \cfNana\c-, the daughter of \cfKaguya Houraisan\c-, and the two became friends. After guiding him back to the village, Ryuji promised her that he'd return one day, to marry her, and take her with him to see the outside world.\n"

"\n"
"While working a typical office job to support the family, Ryuji would additionally have one notable hobby on the side, as an \"inventor\". He would often come up with all sorts of clever tools and machines to help make work around the house easier, and would even get extra money selling some of them to neighbors. His skills gradually improved with time, every year rising one step further in their complexity and scale. Earning him fame throughout the whole city.\n"
"\n"
"One of his most notable achievements is the very house the Miyamoto family lives in. By 2015, their old house was completely reconstructed into a high security underground facility, that would keep the family safe from any catastrophe that might happen to the world. This initial underground home was later expanded even further, as the company formed by Saya and Taro, \cfAkari Labs\c-, kept growing. And as of this article's writing, it is large enough to host most of the workforce of the company.\n"

This came as a surprise, as he was known to be in good health, despite being 98 at the time, in his words, having reached such an age thanks to \"leading a healthy and happy lifestyle\".

Of note is a small group which we made our first contact with, and from whom we learned about most of the situation in this world.

"\cf Ultra-High Caliber Sniper Rifle\c-\n"
"\n"
"The \cfSilver Bullet JET\c- is the 1.150 member of the \cfSilver Bullet\c- series of ultra-high caliber rifles manufactured by \cfBlackmann Arms\c-. It was created as a lighter, more \"reasonable\" alternative to the 1.350 \cfBehemoth\c- model. Weighing 43 kilograms and sporting a total length of 2.4 meters, it is sufficiently compact for non-augmented human use.\n"
"\n"
"The main ammunition designed for this specific model is the 1.150 \cfXSB (eXplosive Super Burst)\c-. These beastly rounds are partially based on a NATO standard 30x113mm cartridge, and employ a low density \cfExplodium\c- shaped charge as propellant, allowing high velocity while still being safe for use. The bullets themselves are composed of a tungsten carbide core, snugly wrapped in an aluminum jacket, and decorated with a thin silver plating for aesthetic appearance (Silver Bullets are, indeed, NOT really made of silver). XSB rounds can penetrate several targets before eventually stopping, depending on their size, they may also do the same for thin walls.\n"
"\n"
"The secondary ammunition is the 1.150 \cfFCB (Fat Chode Bomb)\c-. Personally named by the CEO of Blackmann Arms himself, FCBs are quite similar to the standard XSB ammunition, but instead the bullets are full of additional Explodium, which on impact, is released violently, propagating its deadly blast through solid surfaces. Due to the volatility of these bullets, the propellant employed is slightly less potent, which results in a diminished potential for target penetration, but the blast definitely compensates for this. The explosive charge is so powerful that it can break some walls to pieces.\n"
"\n"
"In order to compensate for its massive recoil, the weapon redirects a part of the gasses from round ignition into a set of jet compensators designed by \cfForx Aeronautics\c-. Although partially cooled in the process, it is still hot enough to cause some damage to users not wearing adequate protection.\n"
"\n"
"\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Shoot the bullet. Any small targets hit by it are pretty much turned to paste. A second press after firing will chamber another round.\n"
"\n"
"\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Tap to switch next reload between XSB and FCB ammunition, if available. Hold and then press primary fire to manually cock, allowing you to retrieve unfired rounds.\n"
"\n"
"\cfReloading:\c- Reloads the weapon. Each magazine holds 5 rounds. An extra round can also be kept chambered.\n"
"\n"
"\cfZoom:\c- Custom-tailored adjustable telescopic sight, up to 16x. Equipped with a soft foam covering to protect the user's face during scoped fire.\n"
"\n"
"\cfTechniques:\c- When going prone to use the bipod, the recoil compensators will automatically disengage, resulting in increased firepower at the cost of less mobility.\n"

"\n"
"The \cfBiospark Carbine\c-, also known by its nickname of \cf\"Sparkster\"\c-, was the flagship weapon of \cfDecade Mechanics\c-, back when it was still active. It is described as being powered by \"sentient lightning\", although it does not show any signs of being truly electric in nature.\n"
"\n"
"Blueprints were found for all models from the S-1 to S-6 (the latter being in early prototyping stages, and not yet functional), but it proved impossible to truly recreate them. Fortunately, over 30,000 ready-made S-5 units were stockpiled deeply inside the ruined facility in \cfSunkaeze\c-, all ready for use. Currently, \cfTach-Engine Technologies\c- and its associated partners manage the distribution of these units, and are also studying the weapons in detail for potential redesigns and enhancements.\n"
"\n"
"One notable detail about the Biospark Carbine is how its \"sentient\" energy drives shot projectiles to seek nearby targets, somehow telling apart friend from foe, relative to the weapon's user. Arcs of lightning have a tendency to spread out from them, dealing additional damage.\n"
"\n"
"\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Small blobs of stabilized energy with slight target-seeking abilities. Leave a trail of arcs that gravitate towards them as they move, then spread out on impact, homing on hostile targets.\n"

"\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Concentrated, penetrating beam shot. Also has some slight seeking.\n"
"\n"
"\cfTertiary Fire:\c- If the loaded charge is at least at 50%, the containment capsule inside will be ejected through the main barrel and detonated as a massive sphere of pure energy that tracks down nearby targets. The weapon must be reloaded afterwards.\n"
"\n"
"\cfReload:\c- Reloads, obviously. Do note that the loaded charge has to be depleted completely before it can be removed. It's possible to attach a second Biospark Unit, for an additional 4-shot charge and less reload downtime, at the expense of some instability. No more than two units can be connected without causing a critical malfunction, however, as some have unfortunately found out.\n"
"\n"
"\cfTechniques:\c- If the secondary beam comes in contact with an energy blob it will be detonated with increased damage and range. This requires precise timing and aim to be truly effective.\n"

"\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n"
"\cfFunny how these rusty-ass things somehow still work. And holy fuck do they work well, too... Y'know, I don't think I've ever seen a weapon that can do that double mag thing, pretty ingenious. Kinda grew to call it the \"double stacc\", heh.\c-\n"

"\cf \"Rhino Stopper\" Spreadgun\c-\n"
"\cxManufacturer:\c-\n"
"\cf Blackmann Arms Ltd.\c-\n"
"\cxClassification:\c-\n"
"\cf Single-shot \"Slide-action\" Shotgun\c-\n"
"\n"
"The \cfSpreadgun\c- is a simple single-shot shotgun with a rather unconventional reload mechanism. Unlike other weapons of the same fashion, the Spreadgun employs an odd variant of break action that \cfBlackmann Arms\c- has described as \"slide-action\", whereas rather than being hinged, the barrel slides horizontally at the press of two side buttons, with a small metal bit springing up and ejecting the loaded shell. After loading in another round, the user merely has to push the barrel back into its closed position. Some have doubts about the practicality of this operation, or its safety, but it's been guaranteed that the gun will not misfire no matter the force exerted to push the barrel back in.\n"
"\n"
"As it is chambered in the rare 10Ga-short type, there's an exclusive assortment of ammunition types it can use, all handled by Blackmann Arms themselves. They are as follows:\n"
"\n"
"\cfStandard Buckshot:\c- Red shells. Exactly what it says on the tin. The spread caused by the shortness of the barrel may make it difficult to reach distant targets, but at close range it should be very effective.\n"
"\n"
"\cfMetal Slug:\c- Green shells. Very potent slugs that have a decent accuracy, even at longer ranges. Due to their size and weight, they can potentially penetrate multiple small targets.\n"
"\n"
"\cfDragon's Breath:\c- White shells. A burst of flame in each shot, has considerable range. Ineffective underwater, for obvious reasons.\n"
"\n"
"\cfKinylum Saltshot:\c- Teal shells. Small chunks of Kinylum in its natural \"salt\" form. Once shot, they leave a trail of boiling hot plasma that remains in the air for a few moments before finally dissipating. In addition, the chunks will explode violently on contact with any surface, or once they \"destabilize\" (which unfortunately makes this type of ammunition ineffective at longer distances).\n"
"\n"
"\cfTelebrium Flechettes:\c- Black shells. Dozens of piercing projectiles tipped with pure Telebrium, an exotic element known for its potent corrosive effects when heated. Targets hit by these projectiles will experience a very painful discharge of corrosive toxins through their bodies (even non-organic ones), although the effects of this will dissipate in a couple seconds. Use of this ammunition is highly restricted, but you have been granted permission to use it against the invading forces.\n"
"\n"
"\cfLead Ball:\c- Purple shells. Coming from \cfPlutoni Incorporated\c-, these rounds shoot out a heavy ball of pure hurt. Despite the fact it's made of lead, it tends to keep its shape no matter how hard it hits something (some wonder if it actually IS made of lead, or if it's something else entirely). Having come out of such a place, it's no surprise that they also have some rather odd effects. It appears that, on certain occasions, the balls may emit odd sounds on impact, which in addition cause some form of potent shockwave around itself, increasing its speed in the process. This odd happening is listed as \"Random Crits\" in the store page.\n"
"\n"
"\cfGolden Shell:\c- Gold-plated shells with a heavy metal body. A highly rare and expensive type of ammunition, with unmatched destructive power. Each round fires a sabot packing a high-grade, high-density \cfExplodium\c- charge, along with gold glitter (which is apparently just for show). Anything directly hit by it is guaranteed to be completely vaporized by the ensuing blast.\n"
"\n"
"The wide range of compatible ammunition types makes the Spreadgun a rather versatile weapon, once you look past its tedious manual reloading. There are however plans to make a much more comfortable semi-automatic, recoil operated variant of this weapon, with prototypes already being tested.\n"
"\n"
"\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Shoot the loaded shell.\n"
"\n"
"\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Tap to select the next ammo type to be used on reload. Hold and then press primary fire to unload the current shell and leave the weapon empty.\n"
"\n"
"\cfReloading:\c- Unload the current shell and load a new one. If the loaded shell was not spent, it will be returned to its ammo pool. Should there not be enough storage space for it, it will be dropped on the ground instead.\n"
"\n"
"\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n"
"\cfYeah, this shit looks impractical af, and I don't know how no one has shot a hole through their hand reloading the damn thing. BUT, it does let you use all sorts of fun ammo. You've got the typical bread and butter of shells there, and then there's... Literal radioactive rock salt, that explodes, yeah, amazing. But then you look at what's right after that and... yeah.\c-\n"
"\n"
"\cfHermann-senpai redirected me to nerdboi for those black shells, because they were his idea. So, let me explain. Telebrium is... a war crime. Plain and simple. We can kind of get away with it, though, because it's just mindless beasts that you're throwing it at. Still makes me uneasy, but hey, we're not using it on people, unlike the actual cases where it WAS used on people (good god, the stories about that).\c-\n"
"\n"
"\cfAnyway, enough about crimes, let's talk about the purple bois. So these things are a serious crime, and THOSE TWO had to be involved of course. I'm pretty sure those things are NOT made of lead. This looks like that weird metal they work with, that I swear to fuck I can't even pronounce the name of. And it has... yes, RANDOM CRITS. Therein lies the crime, Demo-chan. Can't believe we've got that shit going on now. I absolutely lost it when I first saw it in action, and I'm sure you will, too.\c-\n"
"\n"
"\cfLastly there's those golden bois. We can't buy them ourselves, so nerdo made another of his nerdy deals and said that he might reward you every now and then with one for eliminating \"high level targets\" or something like that. Can't wait to see what that shit is like, a fucking... golden shower of pain.\c-\n"

"\n"
"Built in secrecy by \cfQurensniv\c- members of the \cfFaculty of Illuminated Nobodies\c-, a doomsday cult that dates back millions of years into the past, \cfSUSAN\c- is an AI-controlled megastructure a dozen kilometers tall (though most of it is underwater). Its construction was finalized in 2018, and was then immediately activated, after which it began its mission to \"purify the world\" by hijacking Russia's nuclear missile systems (since they were the closest), then over time spreading its control further, reaching other major countries with nuclear weaponry. By the start of 2019 it had already assumed control of all nukes in the entire planet, and a broadcast began, announcing a countdown of three years before all weapons were armed and detonated in unison, bringing forth \"World Purification\".\n"
"\n"
"Many attempts were made to stop this rogue AI, but all failed. Its main structure, located off the coast of \cfKereshnovka\c- proved impenetrable, and any who approached would be swiftly eliminated by its weapons. It was clear that destroying it directly was an impossibility, but some suggested an alternative: Finding a way to \"counter-hack\" it. In mid-2020, a group of the world's most skilled hackers finally neutralized the AI, completely overtaking it. They were so successful, in fact, that they even managed to install various operating systems and programs freely, as it appeared to be based on the same architecture as any standard desktop computer. During many months, people celebrated, having prevented the extinction of all of mankind.\n"
"\n"
"After some analysis of files found in SUSAN, the masterminds behind this doomsday device could be tracked down and brought to justice: Doctor \cfDaniel Perkman\c-, a senior IT engineer at \cfImanaki Corp\c-; \cfHiroshi Yuramaki\c-, Dr. Perkman's assistant and \cfUmbrelle N. Owen\c- (assumed name), current lead of the Qurensniv branch of the FIN. During questioning, Ms. Owen managed to escape, and days later, SUSAN was rebooted and resumed its countdown, but this time, its internal security had been hardened, and all hope was lost for it to be stopped again.\n"
"\n"
"Earth could do nothing but stand in wait, watching the digits of the countdown drop, one by one, with the estimated \"purification\" being set for August of 2021. With only mere months left, there were mass panics, whole cities up in flames, it was chaos. But then, in February of 2021, something unexpected would happen: The \cfLuna Event\c-.\n"
"\n"
"A broadcast was sent from somewhere in the Moon. It was not of human origin, and it overtook all radio and television ranges. The \cfNukuri\c- were announcing their presence, having watched and studied us for countless years. They had remained neutral to all of our various conflicts, but this time they had seen that we were unable to overcome the upcoming disaster, so they would break their vow of non-intervention there and then. Only moments after the broadcast, in an instant, SUSAN was shut down completely, being struck by a blinding flash of light from above. It was clear that this alien race far surpassed us, if they could get rid of it that easily.\n"
"\n"
"It was determined that truly destroying SUSAN would be excessively dangerous for the planet, so it merely remained there, as a massive piece of useless junk drifting around the Arctic Sea. Dismantling it could also be an option, but it would prove too expensive and time consuming of an ordeal.\n"
"\n"
"In 2097, long after the events of \cfWorld War 3\c- and the \cfWhite Scar\c-, with the Nukuri race no longer allied to us and available to defend us, an unidentified alien entity arrived on Earth. A large, floating humanoid figure, clad in white robes and with the appearance of an old man, who announced himself to be \cfGod\c-. Many had a hard time believing such a thing, but others were quick to acknowledge that this was definitely the Abrahamic God himself descending onto Earth from the Heavens. \cf[ed. note: bunch of idiots is what they are]\c-\n"
"\n"
"After making his presence known all across the world, he then approached the deactivated SUSAN structure, and entered it. Those expecting that it would be destroyed were the ones most shocked by what happened next: It was reactivated, and once again resumed all its operations, this time with a much shorter countdown of two years. The words of the godly entity now resonated all over the world. Mankind had proven to be unworthy of walking the Earth, and it was his wish to undo it all, to wipe the planet and start anew, from a clean slate. We had previously interrupted his will, conducted through his most faithful followers, but this time he would not allow that to happen again. Those were his words, and once again, all went back to chaos.\n"
"\n"
"Wounded by the previous war, and now having voluntarily discarded all their technological advances of Nukuri origin, along with cutting all contact with them, there was no chance to fight back. In the last moments of the countdown, the whole world was ready to accept death. What came at the end of this countdown was, however, not that, but something else entirely.\n"
"\n"
"With a roaring shockwave that cleared the skies of the whole planet, a massive explosion erupted from atop SUSAN, expelling large pieces of its internal machinery into space. The cause of this explosion was unknown, but it happened just in time to prevent a much bigger disaster. Many days later, the charred remains of the alien entity were retrieved from the ruins of the megastructure. Many studies would be conducted on the biology of what was assumed to be a dead god.\n"
"\n"
"Religious groups all over the world condemned what was seen as \"the murder of God\" \cf[ed. note: these fucking people...]\c-, but they were all eventually silenced. In a post on social media, \cfMaruku Sarahabinaku\c-, pianist of \cfThe Black Rat's Coven\c- stated that \"the dead one is not one of us\", in response to an article on his autopsy. Questioned about the exact meaning of their response, Maruku would go on to reveal everything about his true nature. The \"false god\" was a man named \cfUruk'Anth\c-, and came from the \cfXevetha\c- race, who were infamous for their attempts to \"achieve artificial godhood\", furthermore, they added that if people wanted to see an actual god, \"you could have just talked to me\".\n"
"\n"
"The reveal of Maruku Sarahabinaku as being an actual deity was followed by that of another member of the band, drummer \cfMykka Psyann\c-. She remarked on actually having known Uruk'Anth, back when he was \"a servant of the tyrant god\". Confusion and disbelief would intermix for a long time, but all eventually settled on accepting what had been said by these two individuals.\n"
"\n"
"SUSAN was finally dismantled in 2130 by the \cfUnion Aerospace Corporation\c-, who would go on to study its various components for potential \"beneficial applications\".\n"
"\n"
"Even though these events have all long passed, everyone remembers. The story of these incidents had not only shown us how easily and quickly all we had ever done could be destroyed, but also came with its two major revelations, one being that we are not alone in the universe, that many alien races exist out there, some peaceful, some hostile; and the other, that gods are more real and truer than anyone could have thought, and that some live among us, without us having ever realized.\n"

"\cfIt's a pretty crazy story, I know, but it all happened. Don't really remember a lot of it, personally, it was veeeery long ago, heh. I do remember though that one thing, that when they hacked the big ol' machine, they put a fucking Minecraft server on it, and it could host a shitton of players without a hitch. They also tried running Crysis, and when they noticed that it ran too smoothly, they started 29 more instances of it, and it still kept being silky smooth. God that was such a fucking mess (and the MC server was still running btw).\c-\n"
"\n"
"\cfAnyway, won't rant more about things you're too young to understand. So yeah, this fucking thing came up and wanted to destroy us all, but with all that we learned that the Nukuri were there, and it was good, and then I met Zana-sama and we became friends, and all that... which obviously got fucking undone by the White Scar (ugh).\c-\n"
"\n"
"\cfAnd yeah, gods. Fucking... GODS. Real damn gods. I actually already knew those two from Ashley-san's band, so yeah, was also quick to have my doubts about that old geezer.

"Following \cfWorld War 3\c-, and with the \cfWhite Scar Treaty\c- in effect, the company was forced to abandon its usage of Nukuri technology, which pretty much meant closing its doors completely.

Having finished high school with excellent grades, he went on to study at many prestigious universities across the world, fueled by the desire to expand his knowledge, especially that of computer technology, which he was infatuated with. Alongside \cfSaya\c-, his younger sister, they founded \cfAkari Labs\c-, a company that specializes in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, among others.

There is quite a lot of controversy surrounding this megacorporation, who not only is known to delve into all sorts of experimentation that has quite blatant potential for disaster (not to mention most of it having military applications), but also faces countless accusations of workers' rights violations.\n"
"\n"
"Following the events of the \cfWhite Scar\c- in 2077, the UAC was one of the main bodies involved in the reconstruction of the fallen \cfUnited States\c-, eventually securing their position of power in the reformed \cfUnion States\c-, as not just the largest military body on Earth, but also one with vast economic and political control.\n"
"\n"
"In recent years, the UAC has been involved in teleportation technology experiments. Through these, they eventually found a way to travel to other worlds. Specifically, to \cfHell\c-. Despite the clearly dangerous implications of such a thing, much was researched of that world ever since the first contact in 2144, and although hostility had been witnessed from the natives, it didn't seem that there was any sign of these creatures becoming a major threat... until a year had passed.\n"
"\n"
"This arrival on Hell from the UAC had unfortunately coincided with a period of major political unrest, which in 2145 reached its boiling point, as the archdemon generals staged a coup, overthrowing the \cfKuriste Royal Family\c-, and setting themselves up as the new rulers. Mad with power, they set their sights on war and conquest, and it just so happened that humans were there, so we became their first target.\n"
"\n"
"Having turned a member of the UAC's science team to their side, he assisted them with the first incursion on Mars City, which served as a first test of their newly built armies. However, they were defeated, having severely underestimated the abilities of humans, and their superior firepower. Their initial plans had to be revised, their armies needed to be stronger, larger. Humanity would be overwhelmed by numbers alone. During the time until their next attack, it's estimated that the population of Hell grew from 370 million to 9.3 billion, thanks to an obscene expansion of their spawning grounds, and improvements on demonic biosynthesis.\n"
"\n"
"In early 2148, with the UAC not having learned their lesson, teleportation experiments resumed, this time limited entirely to short-scale travels between the outposts on Phobos and Deimos. Over time, volunteers who had gone through the portals began to suffer hideous mutations, in some cases being said to result in eventual \"full body explosion\". It wasn't long until they realized what was happening: their portal was being hijacked. Soon enough, demon invaders began warping in from both sides, in vast numbers. Both moon bases eventually fell, and a detachment from Mars City was sent to investigate this \"radio silence\" that had so suddenly happened.\n"
"\n"
"What happened then was the beginning of what's been called the \cfDoom Episodes\c-. As was told by the UAC following these events, one lone marine managed to, by his lonesome, defeat all the invading forces, taking the fight even to Hell itself. However, the exploits of the so-called \cfDoom Marine\c- only served to enrage the archdemon generals even more, and that's when the invasion of Earth began.

"Following the events of the \cfWhite Scar\c- in 2077, the UAC was one of the main bodies involved in the reconstruction of the fallen \cfUnited States\c-, eventually securing their position of power in the reformed \cfUnion States\c-, as not just the largest military body on Earth, but also one with vast economic and political control.\n"
"\n"
"In recent years, the UAC has been involved in teleportation technology experiments. Through these, they eventually found a way to travel to other worlds. Specifically, to \cfHell\c-. Despite the clearly dangerous implications of such a thing, much was researched of that world ever since the first contact in 2144, and although hostility had been witnessed from the natives, it didn't seem that there was any sign of these creatures becoming a major threat... until a year had passed.\n"
"\n"
"This arrival on Hell from the UAC had unfortunately coincided with a period of major political unrest, which in 2145 reached its boiling point, as the archdemon generals staged a coup, overthrowing the \cfKuriste Royal Family\c-, and setting themselves up as the new rulers. Mad with power, they set their sights on war and conquest, and it just so happened that humans were there, so we became their first target.\n"
"\n"
"Having turned a member of the UAC's science team to their side, he assisted them with the first incursion on Mars City, which served as a first test of their newly built armies. However, they were defeated, having severely underestimated the abilities of humans, and their superior firepower. Their initial plans had to be revised, their armies needed to be stronger, larger. Humanity would be overwhelmed by numbers alone. During the time until their next attack, it's estimated that the population of Hell grew from 370 million to 9.3 billion, thanks to an obscene expansion of their spawning grounds, and improvements on demonic biosynthesis.\n"
"\n"
"In early 2148, with the UAC not having learned their lesson, teleportation experiments resumed, this time limited entirely to short-scale travels between the outposts on Phobos and Deimos. Over time, volunteers who had gone through the portals began to suffer hideous mutations, in some cases being said to result in eventual \"full body explosion\". It wasn't long until they realized what was happening: their portal was being hijacked. Soon enough, demon invaders began warping in from both sides, in vast numbers. Both moon bases eventually fell, and a detachment from Mars City was sent to investigate this \"radio silence\" that had so suddenly happened.\n"
"\n"
"What happened then was the beginning of what's been called the \cfDoom Episodes\c-. As was told by the UAC following these events, one lone marine managed to, by his lonesome, defeat all the invading forces, taking the fight even to Hell itself. However, the exploits of the so-called \cfDoom Marine\c- only served to enrage the archdemon generals even more, and that's when the invasion of Earth began. And, as soon as it did, it was quickly brought to an end. The \cfDemolitionist\c-, a collaborative effort of \cfAkari Labs\c- and its many associates, singlehandedly put an end to the invasion, efficiently eliminating every single demon that had come out from the portals, and after that, making their way through Hell itself, much like the Doom Marine, and defeating the \cfIcon of Sin\c-, who commanded the invading armies.\n"
"\n"
"Following this event, the UAC suffered a major restructuring, as most of its board of directors had been lost during the invasions. Now free from its control, the US government tightly supervised their actions, ensuring that they would no longer become a liability. Despite this, three other incidents happened, despite much tighter security protocols. Within one of their bases on Io, yet again they continued their teleportation experiments, this time being prepared for anything. As predicted, a small group of demons came through, but they were swiftly dealt with. What they did NOT predict, however, was that this had merely been a distraction. An unidentified ship had suddenly approached the base, initially assumed to be the usual yearly supply drop. This ship was of demonic construction, imitating the very technology the UAC had. An overwhelming amount of demons were unleashed onto the base, and most were quickly killed or possessed. However, the Doom Marine was also there, and as expected, he once again did what he does best.\n"
"\n"
"One other incident soon followed, within a research facility of undisclosed location. There, the UAC had been working on one way to actively prevent these invasions from ever happening, through something they called \cfQuantum Accelerator Devices\c-. These machines would allegedly serve to close any gates the demons could produce to enter our world, and they did, at first. One gate spawned within the facility, and although some demons managed to make their way in, it was promptly closed and these scarce invaders were gunned down. It seemed then that the experiment was a success, but the demons quickly caught on, and the next day, seven gates opened simultaneously throughout the facility. It took one hour for six of them to be closed, but at that point the invading forces had become overwhelming in numbers, and soon enough everything fell into chaos again. And sure enough, once again, the UAC decided to send their formidable errand boy to deal with it, and so he did, again, as usual. \cf[ed. note: Saya, your sarcasm is showing]\c-\n"
"\n"
"With one final strike to the \cf\"Gatekeeper\"\c-, the titanic demon responsible for the creation of these gateways, it seemed that the invasions would finally be stopped for good. Sure enough, in the following years, all was quiet, and no more incidents were reported. The Doom Episodes were then archived, and the Doom Marine was decommissioned.\n"

"Ten years after this announcement, some worrying news soon reached Earth. Demonic forces had been sighted on several abandoned UAC bases, which were previously thought to all having been thoroughly wiped by radiation bombings. Something had managed to survive there, and was steadily reviving the decayed corpses of the countless fallen demons. Seeing no other choice, the Doom Episodes are reopened, and the very disgruntled Doom Marine was re-commissioned and sent there, this time, after his eventual success, making the decision to stay in Hell, forever, to make sure the demons never attempt an attack ever again. Ever since then, no contact could be made with him.\n"
"\n"
"What little information could be recovered from the other side of all this, that of Hell itself, is that his rampage was unstoppable. He defeated the remaining demon commanders. Tens of thousands of demons, in their mindless rage, all marched towards their deaths by his hand. There was hope among the civilian population that this one human, now rebaptized by the title of \cfDoom Slayer\c-, would put an end to the tyranny of the archdemon generals, but they had their plans for him. They were fully aware that should he make his way to the capital city of \cfDis\c- once again, they would not be able to stop him. So a trap was set, and he fell right into it.

"\n"
"\cfMisa Azadeku Unissix\c- is the youngest member of the \cfUnissix Clan\c-, who leads the nation of \cfDevanikna\c-. She's the second child of \cfDevai Unissix\c- and \cfSerwand Nerukousei\c-, being the younger sister of \cfDeneva Unissix\c-, one of the most renowned warriors in the entire nation.\n"
"\n"
"Due to being a child of mixed blood (as her father is not Devanikan, but rather a \"Chimera\", a term used to describe people born artificially through alchemical means), Misa was often shunned by members of other clans, who would describe her as a \"crossbred monstrosity\", and accuse her father of polluting the Unissix bloodline with nefarious intentions. Her sister would receive the same treatment, but was much more capable of ignoring it, while Misa however suffered a great deal during her whole life.\n"
"\n"
"One thing that set her apart from her sister, was that she was much less physically capable, being \"too weak\" and \"not suited to be a dragonblood warrior\", it was noted too that unlike her brethren, she could not perform a dragon form summoning, either. All of this would also be used against her by the people who regularly bullied her. Her family eventually decided for her to always stay indoors, shut off from the outside world. It was through this that she eventually found her main hobby: Smithing.\n"
"\n"
"Misa found great enjoyment in creating all sorts of armor and weaponry, which would then be used by her family, or sold to other clans (who did not know who made them, but were very impressed by the quality), this was the beginning of \cfUnissix Crafts\c-, her little workshop/store. Expressing her creativity through it helped a lot to keep her thoughts away from all that was happening outside, and she felt much more relaxed.\n"
"\n"
"With time, and as she kept improving her skills, she found interest in greater challenges, such as far more complex weaponry than mere blades and others. To satisfy this desire, her family would bring to her books on \"weapons of legend\", which the young Misa managed to replicate almost to perfection, much to the surprise of all. She was quite proud of what she had achieved, and this further boosted her popularity, which resulted in personal requests for many of those replicas to be made.\n"
"\n"
"In 2016, the Unissix Clan received the visit of a \cfNukuri\c- woman, \cfZanaveth Nekuraku II\c-, who wished to study their culture and history. She was welcomed to stay at their home for as long as she wanted, as it was quite rare for them to have any visitors, and they were also intrigued by this individual from a species they had never seen before. During her stay, she'd eventually get to meet Misa, and would frequently watch her work. Misa initially felt quite shy around this odd white-as-snow woman who had appeared so suddenly, but as the days passed, and they got to interact more, they became quite close.\n"
"\n"
"One morning, Misa's parents were given some surprising news. Zanaveth II wished to marry their daughter, and bring her to her homeworld, citing that she'd be much safer by her side. They very happily agreed to this proposition, and thanked her for what she had done. Ever since that day, Misa has never left Zanaveth II's side, always being with her, wherever she went. In 2042, during a stay on Earth with a mutual friend, the two had a child, \cfZanaveth Nekuraku III\c-.\n"
"\n"
"Although Misa was quite happy living with her wife, there was a major issue that popped up once she had moved in to \cfNahkami\c- with her: Her identity. Around that time, the \cfYathai Empire\c- was known to have a very negative \cf[ed. note: more like \"murdery\"]\c- stance on what the emperor saw as \"degeneracy\". Knowing that Misa would potentially be executed just like other members of family had been in the past, Zanaveth II had to ensure that the fact her wife was transgender was kept secret, much to her discomfort, having to then publicly present as male to the whole world, and additionally being unable to receive any treatment.\n"
"\n"
"In 2068, When WW7 broke out, the two, along with their child, took the chance to flee to \cfSankaideriha\c-, the island of magic. There, Zanaveth II introduced Misa to a certain alchemist, \cfArchmage Kounan\c-, who was famous for providing what was known popularly as \"magic-based HRT\". For Misa, this was nothing short of miraculous, as in a matter of minutes, she would find herself in a body she could call her own, all solely by drinking one potion.\n"
"\n"
"Misa and her wife stayed in the island until 2108, when they were notified about the end of the war, along with the fall of the empire, and the rise of a more fair and welcoming society. These were wonderful news for them, and after saying their goodbyes to the people of the land of magic, they returned home. Ever since then, and with Zanaveth II being elected as \"Minister of Interspecies Relations\", the two now travel around the world together.\n"

Bless Zana-sama with that timely rescue there, like, from what I heard, all that awful bullying was REALLY getting to her, poor thing.

"\n"
"\cfAlso, funny story. The first time I visited them when they were in Sankaideriha, Misa gave me one hell of a scare with that sudden transformation she went through. It's like... she was a completely different person entirely. Like, I had never seen her so happy before, it was really something else, and honestly I was also happy for her too. Ah, and then that other thing happened, when uhhh... we went to a hot springs together. I... accidentally... saw... down there, yeah...\c-\n"

"\cf \"Wallbuster\" Heavy Armor Breaching Shotgun\c-\n"
"\cxManufacturer:\c-\n"
"\cf Blackmann Arms Ltd.\c-\n"
"\cf Design by Mr. BIG SHOT\c-\n"
"\cxClassification:\c-\n"
"\cf Revolver Shotgun\c-\n"
"\n"
"The \cfWallbuster\c- is a beefy beast of a shotgun, sporting a total of 25 barrels divided into individually rotating 5-barrel cylinders. Like other shotguns from \cfBlackmann Arms\c-, it is chambered for the somewhat rare 10Ga-short caliber. This huge weapon was commissioned by \cfMr. BIG SHOT\c- himself, and of the many others \cfBlackmann Arms\c- has made for him, it is the only one that was made public, and it's said that the others may be even more ludicrous.\n"
"\n"
"The internal mechanisms driving this weapon have such a degree of complexity that they've been described as \cf\"Kraut Deep Space Magic\"\c- by some. Only \cfHermann E. Ischer\c- himself knows every detail about their operation. With each twist of the main trigger, the topmost barrel is primed, and then its cylinder spins counter-clockwise, with the next round ready for shooting. On a complete rotation, or when the secondary trigger is used, the main body spins afterwards, switching to another cylinder.\n"
"\n"
"The Wallbuster is compatible with most types of 10Ga-short shells distributed by Blackmann, although there are safety restrictions on some, namely dragon's breath, flechettes, and golden shells. This limits the range of ammunition usable to only these four types:\n"
"\n"
"\cfStandard Buckshot:\c- Red shells. Exactly what it says on the tin. Quite lethal at short range, and with some extra reach due to the length of the weapon's barrels.\n"
"\n"
"\cfMetal Slug:\c- Green shells. Very potent slugs that have a decent accuracy, even at longer ranges. Due to their size and weight, they can potentially penetrate multiple small targets.\n"
"\n"
"\cfKinylum Saltshot:\c- Teal shells. Small chunks of Kinylum in its natural \"salt\" form. Once shot, they leave a trail of boiling hot plasma that remains in the air for a few moments before finally dissipating. In addition, the chunks will explode violently on contact with any surface, or once they \"destabilize\" (which unfortunately makes this type of ammunition ineffective at longer distances).\n"
"\n"
"\cfLead Ball:\c- Purple shells. Coming from \cfPlutoni Incorporated\c-, these rounds shoot out a heavy ball of pure hurt. Despite the fact it's made of lead, it tends to keep its shape no matter how hard it hits something (some wonder if it actually IS made of lead, or if it's something else entirely). Having come out of such a place, it's no surprise that they also have some rather odd effects. It appears that, on certain occasions, the balls may emit odd sounds on impact, which in addition cause some form of potent shockwave around itself, increasing its speed in the process. This odd happening is listed as \"Random Crits\" in the store page.\n"
"\n"
"Despite this limitation, with just these four types one can make of the Wallbuster a quite mighty companion. Especially taking into account the semi-automatic nature of the weapon, allowing for a quick succession of shots or even shooting multiple shells simultaneously.\n"
"\n"
"\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Shoots the topmost barrel.\n"
"\n"
"\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Shoots the topmost cylinder.\n"
"\n"
"\cfTertiary Fire:\c- Shoots it all, if you really want to.\n"
"\n"
"\cfReloading:\c- Once the side lever is pulled down, the cylinders can be safely detached and reloaded individually. For reloading on the go, it's recommended to have a \cfMagnetic Utility Belt\c- or similar at hand, as it will make this operation easier. Speed loaders are available for purchase from the Blackmann Arms website, or from authorized distributors. Clever operators might also choose to carry spare pre-loaded cylinders.\n"
"\n"
"\cfTechniques:\c- True to its name, you can destroy all sorts of obstacles along the way, provided you're dealing enough damage relative to their size (requiring secondary or tertiary fire). This even includes locked doors, so you won't have to bother with key hunting anymore.\n"
"\n"
"\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n"
"\cfOK so, this ballbusting hunk of metal. Yeah, now ain't that some good shit...\c-\n"
"\n"

"A very robust and durable plate armor made of the finest almasteel in \cfDevanikna\c-. Part of the standard lineup from \cfUnissix Crafts\c-, designed for the skilled adventurer who needs decent protection from the attacks of mighty beasts. It is also imbued with defensive magic that enhances elemental resistances on the wearer. Generally, this chestpiece is also distributed along with other parts comprising a full armor set, but it's not like you can wear all of them, with the body type you have.\n"
"\n"
"\cxAnalysis data:\c-\n"
"This piece of armor offers a massive reduction to incoming damage of basic elemental nature (i.e.: heat, cold, electricity, etc.), the factor being of 80%. In addition, the plating itself offers a 50% reduction to damages of other natures, plus a 70% absorption of explosive impacts. The total absorption amounts to 250 units of damage before it's entirely worn out. Due to its size, it can easily be worn over lighter armors.\n"

"\n"
"In June of 2073, the \cfNukuri Seventh World War\c- began. It was one more attempt by the \cfNahkami Liberation Front\c- to put an end to the oppressive rule of the \cfYathai Empire\c-, this time expected to be their final. When the news of this conflict reached Earth, \cfPresident Dick Richardson\c- of the \cfUnited States\c- made some rather noxious comments on social media directed at \cfLedora Yathai\c-, head of the Nukuri empire. As expected, they were not very well received, and an escalation of insults ensued. Many Nukuri who had settled on Earth fled in protest, as the ball kept rolling. At its boiling point, the Nukuri emperor, fed up with all this, officially declared war on the United States, ready to launch a direct attack as \"punishment for their insolent attitude\". Ground units were deployed in September of 2074, and thus the war began.\n"
"\n"
"There were many losses on both sides, including civilians, in a chaotic confrontation between people who, not long before, had been peacefully allied for half a century. In three years, the vastly superior Nukuri armies neutralized all opposition, and set their sights on the very heart of the country. Wishing to \"slay the beast from within\", a small team managed to locate and capture the president. He was given one last choice, right there and then. He could either surrender and publicly apologize for his affront to the empire, or he could refuse, and watch as the \cfEmperor's Wrath\c- falls down upon him.\n"
"\n"
"He chose the latter option, and what followed was nothing short of unimaginably despicable and cruel. All Nukuri forces retreated, and they evacuated any remaining civilian Nukuri who still remained. Then, in an instant, a succession of blinding flashes of scorching light reduced the whole United States territory to ashes, coming from the experimental orbital weapon the empire had built many years prior. It was its very first test fire, and the actual scale and effects of it were not yet known. Some say that the apocalyptic effects it had were not truly intended, that the plan was not to put an end to all life, but rather only cause destruction on a more \"technical\" level, disabling all electronic devices and machinery. Suffice to say, when the lead designer of this weapon, \cfZanaveth Nekuraku I\c-, saw what had happened, he suffered a severe mental breakdown, and disappeared from the public eye for many years.\n"
"\n"
"With this attack, the flames of the war against the empire only got stronger. In addition, all the remaining Nukuri on Earth were forced to leave, and with the exception of a select few countries, the \cfWhite Scar Treaty\c- was signed almost unanimously, putting an end to half a century of Nukuri contributions to the evolution of our science and technology. Those who had signed had to reject anything made by them, and no longer make any contact with any member of their species. In addition, they were no longer allowed to remain on their Moon colony either, forcing the \cfLuna Research Institute\c- to close its doors after almost four thousand years.\n"
"\n"
"Everyone wanted the emperor's head. Not only had it been a major mistake for humanity to have enraged him, but it had been an even bigger mistake from HIS part to have used that weapon. 30 years into the chaotic seventh war, a member of the Nekuraku family notified one very specific group of what had happened: The \cfUniversity of Nos-Kora\c-. Serving as the embassy of the ancient \cfMishe\c- race, the University had always stayed neutral to the various internal conflicts among the Nukuri, but this time, they stepped in. What the emperor had done, in the eyes of the founding \cfNukritas Brothers\c-, was unforgivable. It was described by them as \"the second most disappointing display of heartless destruction\" they had ever witnessed.\n"
"\n"
"\cfNukritas 1xx\c- would then, by himself, walk all the way down from the northernmost region of Akane to the imperial capital in Vutaki. His advance could not be stopped, he shrugged off any attempts by imperial soldiers, he destroyed their weapons merely by looking at them. Once he reached the imperial palace, he kicked the doors open and made his way to the throne, there, emperor Ledora Yathai, frozen in terror, received a single punch across the gut from the Mishe ambassador, and was sent flying in a straight line out the window, reaching such a velocity that he completely vanished into the void of space. Then, the University made their announcement, the \cfNos-Kora Ultimatum\c-. The Nukuri race was given eight years to resolve their conflicts and make peace. Should they have failed to do so, the University would close its doors forever, and the Mishe would formally leave the \cfX'Animen Coalition\c-, taking their valuable knowledge with them.\n"
"\n"
"This threat was taken very seriously, as the Mishe were one of the most important members of this interplanetary alliance, and so a massive reform followed. Both sides were now united in their mission to rebuild Nahkami in its entirety as a new nation. In 2108, only halfway through the time limit they had set, the \cfNukuri Unified Government\c- was finally established, with \cfZanata Nekuraku II\c- as \"transitional\" prime minister. Following this, an attempt was made to reestablish relations with Earth, but it was useless, they were completely ignored, save for two countries who had not signed the treaty: Scotland and Japan.\n"
"\n"
"These two countries were host to powerful corporations that had been long time partners of Zanata's own company, \cfNekuratek\c-, and were fully aware of the truth of the situation, hence why they had refused to break bonds with them. Of note regarding this were various statements on social media from \cfSaya Miyamoto\c-, head of the Japanese \cfAkari Labs\c-, condemning all those who had signed the treaty for their \"gross generalization\" in seeing the entirety of the Nukuri as an enemy.\n"
"\n"
"No further attempts have been made ever since to try once again to reestablish the former alliance, not even during many major events that would threaten Earth once again, where they would have gladly come to our aid as they had done in the \cfLuna Event\c- of 2021. Earth was, in addition, barred from the possibility of entering the X'Animen Coalition due to this fierce opposition.\n"
"\n"
"\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n"
"\cfLo and behold, here it be, the darkest moment in human history (to date). Seriously, it fucks me up thinking again about what had happened, it was some awful shit. Like, not just the whole fucking burnination of an entire country, but also what was going down on the other side too, all the stuff Zana-sama told me about.\c-\n"
"\n"
"\cfI mean, sure, from this one can guess that the Nukuri were anything but peaceful, but that's not even half of it. The empire, the fucking empire, it was all the goddamn stinking bitch-ass piece of shit empire. Fucking, megalomaniacal evil-ass genocidal shithead emperor running the show, doing whatever the fuck he wanted. All those wars, it was all people who wanted him gone, and he'd crush them, over and over, with no remorse. He ran the place, and he could do whatever he wanted to them, like the ugly bastard he was. Yeah, I heard all of it. The mass executions, going as far as to bringing not one, but TWO whole races to extinction, yeah, THAT was sure fucked up. Oh but what about, torturing and massacring people who were seen as \"traitors\" and \"deviants\", huh? Yeah, that shit too. Zana-sama lost a lot of her family because of that. Ugh, I swear, one day I'm going to nail down where that bastard was yeeted to, just so I can kick him into paste. I'll obviously start with the balls, for sure, that one's for the other thing he did, which I'm not going to talk about here because I mean, holy fuck, this got dark (and it gets even darker). I have GOOD reasons to hate someone as fucking disgustingly vile as this motherfucker, hell, \"motherfucker\" is not even close there, considering what he did. Yeah, I think you get the hint now, do you? I bet you'd want to get your hands on him too. God damn if only those crazy guys hadn't yeeted him into space...\c-";

"\n"
"\cfXekke\c- is the largest nation in \cfIxxeney\c-, itself also the largest planet of the \cfZenna system\c-. Covering the mountainous regions west of the neighboring nation of \cfDevanikna\c-, it is the home of the \cfXekkian\c-, a race of gigantic humanoids (averaging at 3 meters of height).\n"
"\n"
"The nation is led by the king and queen of Xekke, currently \cfMal Kuratagon\c-, grandson of madness deity \cfMaruku Sarahabinaku\c- and \cfMysu Adasake\c-, youngest daughter of the \cfAdasake Mask Bearers\c-. In addition, the madness deity also serves as patron of the Xekkian people.\n"
"\n"
"Among the various member civilizations of the \cfX'Animen Coalition\c-, the Xekkian are one of the most technologically advanced, though only a few steps behind the \cfNukuri\c-. They are well known for all their achievements in the military field, and many of their weapons are famous throughout, as well as the strength of the titan armies. As a matter of fact, a majority of the coalition members often hire Xekkian mercenaries for their defense.\n"
"\n"
"Structurally speaking, the whole nation is divided into only five cities, each of them very broadly separated from each other, and located in some strategic spot among the mountains. The smallest of them is the capital city of Adkesa, standing atop the tallest peak of Ixxeney, and from which it's said that the king can clearly see the other four cities. Also in the capital city is the Nukuri embassy, which in 1793 BC had fallen to a terrorist attack in response to general displeasure with the \cfYathai Imperial Family\c-. It would remain in ruins until the fall of the empire, after which it was promptly rebuilt to signify the Xekkian people's approval of the \cfNahkami Liberation Front\c-'s victory.\n"
"\n"
"Of the people themselves, what is first noted is their eloquence. The Xekkas language spoken by all feels rather ominous and potent with each word spoken, well-suited for the intense personalities most of them exude. However, although they may appear to be fierce and imposing, they also know well to show kindness to those who need it, as is taught by their patron deity.\n"

"\cfPS: We've confirmed it (well, Misa did, directly), this thing is effective against gods too. Not enough to kill, but it does have some very... notable destructive effects.

She ate up the whole damn blast, burned through most of her body leaving bones exposed.

"\n"
"Born in 2009 to \cfNana\c- and \cfRyuji Miyamoto\c-, \cfYui\c- is the youngest of three siblings. She's quite an empathetic and sociable person, completely unlike her relatively gloomier, more reclusive older sister and brother \cfSaya\c- and \cfTaro\c-, having always shown a clear interest in helping other people. Since her childhood, her wish had been to become a doctor, \"to save lives\". This wish came to fruition after persevering through her studies, and many years slowly \"ascending the ranks\". As of this article's writing, Yui currently works as a neurosurgeon at \cfKasukabe Central Hospital\c-, and has received several awards for her outstanding achievements.\n"
"\n"
"On a more personal side, Yui has a wide variety of interests, which some have noted as amusing in how contrasting they can be. For example, she's known to be an avid fan of wrestling, but she's just as crazy about it as she is for chess. She also enjoys various types of music that would normally be felt as \"conflicting\" with each other. Truly, Yui Miyamoto is a woman of contrasts. \cf[ed. note: thanks, spat all over my keyboard here]\c-\n"
"\n"
"For a long time, Yui had been a fan of a certain British band, \cfThe Black Rat's Coven\c-. She really enjoyed their music, and was absolutely enamored with the lead singer, \cfAshley Knox\c-. She often fantasized about dating her, much to the mockery of her friends, and truly, seriously wished one day she'd show up at her door, asking her to be her girlfriend.\n"
"\n"
"All of this was clearly never going to happen, and she knew it, but one day, the band visited Japan during one of their tours, and she got to see them live. Yui and her sister, who was also a fan, were quick to get tickets for the concert and head there as fast as they could. The experience was something else, being so close to them. Yui could swear that sometimes, Ashley would look at her and smile, but she dismissed it as probably being her imagination, or something.\n"
"\n"
"After the concert, she excitedly lined up to get an autograph, and that's when the impossible became possible. Once in front of the \cf\"Stylish Witch of the West\"\c-, Yui nervously asked her, but what she got instead were some words that left her frozen in place: \"You're a very cute gal. Wanna go out with me?\". Suffice to say, the two are now happily married.\n"

During her childhood, she showed great promise, being quite the quick learner, but rather than pressuring her to study harder, or putting her on a higher level place of study, her parents decided instead on letting her keep going at her own pace, which was something unheard of at the time.\n"
"\n"
"Having finished secondary studies in 2005, Zanaveth II opted to spend some time working at the family business, \cfNekuratek\c-, where she'd come to learn the ins and outs of AI and robotics, a field she had a lot of interest in. In 2009, Coinciding with the opening of new courses at the \cfUniversity of Nos-Kora\c-, and under recommendation by her grandmother, \cfZanata II\c-, Zanaveth II enrolled in \cfExtraspecies Studies\c-, as it appeared to be the perfect way for her to see the world, having only ever spent all of her life at the time in her home province of Akai.\n"
"\n"
"As part of this course, Zanaveth II would travel all over the \cfX'Animen Coalition\c-, being introduced to the many species that inhabit the various allied planets, and studying their diverse cultures and stories.

In 2016, as internal conflicts between warring clans of the \cfDevanikan\c- people had finally subdued, Zanaveth II took the chance to pay them a visit, previously having been unable to.

"\n"
"Through her weekly visits to Japan, Zanaveth II became quite interested in the country's culture and entertainment. She was quick to point out notable similarities between them and the Nukuri, extending even to their language, something that greatly amused her. On social media, her usual posts would often be drowned out by extensive rants about anime and videogames, often intertwining with those of Saya Miyamoto.\n"
"\n"
"In August 20th of 2042, Zanaveth II and Misa had a child, \cfZanaveth Nekuraku III\c-, the first Nukuri born and raised on Earth. Due to the restrictive laws at the time, however, the family had to return to Nahkami once their child was ready to enter school by the age of 4. They would occasionally still visit Earth once again, during holidays, though.\n"
"\n"
"In the wake of the \cfNukuri Seventh World War\c- of 2068, Zanaveth II fled with her wife and child to \cfSankaideriha\c- with the help of Nukuri witch \cfSaniuke Okusainaya\c-, old friend of her family. Two years later, after showing notable difficulties settling in, the family decided to leave Zanaveth III in Saya's care. This would last until 2077, when the \cfWhite Scar\c- incident prompted the expulsion of all Nukuri on Earth. Zanaveth III was then sent to live with her grandparents for the time being, until the end of the war in 2104, when her parents returned to Nahkami once again.\n"
"\n"
"Since the formation of the \cfNukuri Unified Government\c- in 2108, Zanaveth II holds the position of \"Minister of Interspecies Relations\", thanks in part to her outstanding achievements during her time as a student of the University of Nos-Kora.\n"

The two quickly became close friends, and as proof of this friendship, Zanaveth II agreed to provide \cfAkari Labs\c- with the advanced \cfNekuronbot AI Framework\c- to further improve their creations.\n"
"\n"
"Through her weekly visits to Japan, Zanaveth II became quite interested in the country's culture and entertainment. She was quick to point out notable similarities between them and the Nukuri, extending even to their language, something that greatly amused her. On social media, her usual posts would often be drowned out by extensive rants about anime and videogames, often intertwining with those of Saya Miyamoto.\n"
"\n"
"In August 20th of 2042, Zanaveth II and Misa had a child, \cfZanaveth Nekuraku III\c-, the first Nukuri born and raised on Earth. Due to the restrictive laws at the time, however, the family had to return to Nahkami once their child was ready to enter school by the age of 4. They would occasionally still visit Earth once again, during holidays, though.\n"
"\n"
"In the wake of the \cfNukuri Seventh World War\c- of 2068, Zanaveth II fled with her wife and child to \cfSankaideriha\c- with the help of Nukuri witch \cfSaniuke Okusainaya\c-, old friend of her family. Two years later, after showing notable difficulties settling in, the family decided to leave Zanaveth III in Saya's care. This would last until 2077, when the \cfWhite Scar\c- incident prompted the expulsion of all Nukuri on Earth. Zanaveth III was then sent to live with her grandparents for the time being, until the end of the war in 2104, when her parents returned to Nahkami once again.\n"
"\n"
"Since the formation of the \cfNukuri Unified Government\c- in 2108, Zanaveth II holds the position of \"Minister of Interspecies Relations\", thanks in part to her outstanding achievements during her time as a student of the University of Nos-Kora.\n"
"\n"
"As of 2171, Zanaveth II has also been involved in negotiations with the \cfAnarukon\c- people, as part of a \"multiversal expansion\" of the \cfBleaknet\c-. In addition, through a deal with \cfAkari Labs\c-, Earth will also receive its own node to the Bleaknet Nexus. This last action is part of a greater plan to restore relations between Humans and Nukuri, putting an end to the White Scar Treaty.\n"

"\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n"
"\cfAhhhhhh, damn. She really is the sweetest and cutest gal I've ever met, let me tell ya. And it's one hell of an achievement for me to get this alien cutie to become a complete weeb too, heh...\c-\n"
"\n"
"\cfOh man, meeting her was the best christmas gift ever. And also her smol cinnamon roll of a wife, too, huhuhu... Lucky devil, getting herself a girl like that. It was hella fun to hang out with them, especially because of how excited Zana-sama was about everything around the city. She was like a little kid in a candy shop at times. ABSOLUTELY FUCKING ADORABLE.\c-\n"
"\n"
"\cfNow that the White Scar trash garbage is going to get all torn to shreds, I'm definitely looking forward to seeing her around once again. God, when she popped up after the wedding with Kirin-kun I almost broke down crying. I missed her so goddamn much, like... seriously.\c-";

It was in school that the young child began to have notable issues.\n"
"\n"
"Zanaveth III was a frequent victim of bullying by her classmates, due to her odd personality and mannerisms, this was further intensified due to the effects of her Yikazoroi (lit. \"Stress Burst\"), a disorder prevalent among Nukuri children (though only developed by 1 in 200), which caused the constant bullying to eventually result in violent outbursts, which then further intensified the bullying. Due to the inaction of the school staff at the time, her mother sued them, and she had to be moved to a different school across the province.\n"

"\n"
"During her stay on Earth, Zanaveth III has had quite a noteworthy history on social media and online forums, arising from her strange personal dialect of English and nonsensical ramblings.

"\cfLil' chuuni Zana-chan. Sure, she may look cold and distant and antisocial and stuff, but that really can be blamed on how shit people have been to her. God I wish I could just beat up all of her bullies. I remember how she'd often come to me crying, all angry and frustrated after getting into trouble and I'd just sit her down on my lap and give her headpats and hugs. Ahhhhh... really made me feel like a mommy right there.\c-\n"

"\cfI miss that stuff, I really do. Petting that soft fluffy blue hair of hers. Wish I knew what she's up to now, that whole thing of \"world domination\" totally does sound like her thing wwwww\c-\n"

"\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n"
"\cfAh, my precious little chuuni. It was such a surprise to see her pop up at my place out of nowhere like that, gave me a good scare. But there we were once again, reunited like in the old times. She was covered in bruises and burns and her makeup was all over the place from crying, poor thing. I gave her lots of hugs and pets, all she needed. Even went and gave her a bath like when she was little, hehehe.\c-\n"
"\n"
"\cfOh yeah, and also that thing. Yeah, I hope she keeps that a secret from Zana-sama. I may have um... well, I \"gave her a hand\", if you know what I mean. I thought it'd help her cheer up a bit, as silly as the idea was, but she liked it, huhuhu...\c-\n"
"\n"
"\cfAnd then just like that, she left again, *sigh*\c-";
