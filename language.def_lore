It was in school that the young child began to have notable issues.\n\nZanaveth III was a frequent victim of bullying by her classmates, due to her odd personality and mannerisms, this was further intensified due to the effects of her Yikazoroi (lit. \"Stress Burst\"), a disorder prevalent among Nukuri children (though only developed by 1 in 200), which caused the constant bullying to eventually result in violent outbursts, which then further intensified the bullying. Due to the inaction of the school staff at the time, her mother sued them, and she had to be moved to a different school across the province.\n\nIn the wake of the \cfNukuri Seventh World War\c-, Zanaveth III and her parents fled temporarily to \cfSankaideriha\c-, aided by a friend of the Nekuraku family. During their stay there, it would be noted that their child had difficulty settling in, citing that being there gave her \"mind shock\". A formal diagnosis noted that she was reacting negatively to the natural flux of magic within the island, and it was suggested that she stayed with someone else, outside the island. The two eventually would put Zanaveth III in the care of \cfSaya Miyamoto\c-, a friend her mother had made during her first visit to Earth.\n\nZanaveth III stayed on Earth with Saya until the flames of war spread there, with the \cfWhite Scar\c- incident.

After this, she announced the beginning of her \"plan for world domination\".\n\nDuring her stay on Earth, Zanaveth III has had quite a noteworthy history on social media and online forums, arising from her strange personal dialect of English and nonsensical ramblings. Saya Miyamoto has come to label her as \cfChuunibyou\c-, an old Japanese term used to denote the kind of traits she shows, such as the noted self-importance and desire to stand out, along with pretending to have special powers / possess arcane knowledge, and other fanciful sentiments.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfLil' chuuni Zana-chan. Sure, she may look cold and distant and antisocial and stuff, but that really can be blamed on how shit people have been to her. God I wish I could just beat up all of her bullies. I remember how she'd often come to me crying, all angry and frustrated after getting into trouble and I'd just sit her down on my lap and give her headpats and hugs. Ahhhhh... really made me feel like a mommy right there.\c-\n\n\cfI miss that stuff, I really do. Petting that soft fluffy blue hair of hers. Wish I knew what she's up to now, that whole thing of \"world domination\" totally does sound like her thing wwwww\c-\n\n\cfWell, if she comes here to Earth I'd welcome my new chuuni overlord with open arms.\c-";

It was such a surprise to see her pop up at my place out of nowhere like that, gave me a good scare. But there we were once again, reunited like in the old times.

Even went and gave her a bath like when she was little, hehehe.\c-\n\cfOh yeah, and also that thing. Yeah, I hope she keeps that a secret from Zana-sama.

The cause of this facility falling into ruin is unknown, and according to certain reports, may be connected to the death of the one individual that has been found referenced in most of the retrieved blueprints and research documents, the mechanical demigod \cfMaester Mekes\c-.\n\nOf the many products successfully retrieved, the \cfBiospark Carbine\c- is one of the most notable. It was devised as the \"signature weapon of \cfDecade Mechanics\c-\", and described as \"a piercing lance of electricity capable of deep thought\". No one has been able to reverse engineer this odd weapon. There are an estimated 30,000 units stored within the facility, and their distribution is currently controlled by \cfTach-Engine Technologies\c-, its founder being the main discoverer of this weapon, who has shown interest in studying this weapon in more detail.\n\nFurthermore, there are many rumors spread by explorers that the ruins are haunted.

She initially saw this as a blessing, allowing her to work on everything she ever wanted, without any time limits, but afterwards, remarked on the fact that she would forever be stuck with her current physique, being \"short and flat\", something she absolutely hated.\n\nSaya would frequently be nicknamed \cf\"Not-Tomoko\"\c- around the net, in reference to a character from a popular manga series that people compared her with. It was noted that \"in term of personality and looks, the resemblance is definitely there\". Saya is well known for being quite blunt when talking to people, if she ever actually does so, as she's not very talkative in person. Online, however, she changes entirely, openly talking to anyone she comes across, casually shoving herself into random conversations, or extensively ranting about various topics, and debating fiercely with haters.\n\nSaya is also known for being exaggeratedly flirty around attractive women, something which has resulted in many misunderstandings and awkward moments. She proudly states that she's \"always horny on main\", and never lets any chance to flirt with someone slip past her. She however remarks that this open flirting is \"just a friendly thing, between friends\".\n\nSaya has many hobbies, including programming (her language of choice being \cfHaskell\c-), collecting videogames (most of which she doesn't actually play), drawing, 3d modeling and writing. Her fascination with anime and manga got her to write her very own: a three-volume series called \cfMy Maid Is A Sex Robot\c-, partially based around her experiences with dating \cfMaidbot Miyamoto\c-. It became so popular it managed to get its own anime adaptation years later. Saya also wrote a science fiction novel, \cfThe Akari Project\c-, a story about teleportation experiments and interdimensional travel \"that doesn't go to shit like all the others\".

Over time, Saya would expand on her abilities, allowing for more complex interactivity, but still too limited. Saya had always felt that despite all her efforts, despite how close Maidbot gradually got to be more \"life-like\", it was never enough. In the end, she was \"still a machine\".\n\nOf note was Saya's attempt to get her into singing, something which was an unexpected success, actually. After her initial debut, more and more artists would compose songs for Maidbot to perform. By 2020, Maidbot had become a full-fledged \"Artificial Idol\", famous enough to take part in the Tokyo Olympics, singing the national anthem.\n\nFollowing the \cfLuna Event\c- of 2021, Saya received the visit of \cfZanaveth Nekuraku II\c-, head of AI research at \cfNekuratek\c-, the largest \cfNukuri\c- tech conglomerate. Curious about human culture, she decided to meet her, as they had quite similar interests. Zanaveth was quite impressed by all \cfAkari Labs\c- had achieved, and showed special interest in Maidbot, too.\n\nHaving quickly befriended Saya at this point, she offered to enhance Maidbot's AI with the more advanced technology her people had: The \cfNekuronbot AI Framework\c-. Having accepted this offer, Maidbot was \"reborn\" from her previous, limited form. She was now fully capable of individual thought, free will, and most importantly, emotion.\n\nIt was not surprising that Saya had always felt something towards her, while still being fully aware of the impossibility of her being able to love her back, but now, everything had changed. Maidbot knew, and confessed that in her new form, she could \"feel something\" too. Over time, she came to better understand these feelings, and would become Saya's first girlfriend.\n\nAfter these events, Maidbot became a full member of the family, adopting the Miyamoto name. Much later, and with Zanaveth's assistance, Saya would begin the creation of more maidbots, wishing for the whole world to be able to have a Maidbot of their own. An adoption service was set up in 2023, where maidbots, who'd be raised and prepared at Akari Labs, would hold interviews with potential adopters, allowing them to have the final choice on who to live with. This service was entirely free, as the company already had more than enough funds coming from their other services, which increased their popularity even more. Everyone wished to have their own Maidbot, and the Maidbots themselves were more than happy to live with their new families.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfMeido-chan is so sweet~ And her voice is so nice~\c-\n\n\cfI'm sure you two will become good friends one day, that'll be fun.

I remember I'd always fantasize about Meido-chan becoming self-aware and confessing her love to me, and I'd think that was TOTALLY impossible. Heh... silly ol' me.\c-\n\n\cfHehe...

It is described as being powered by \"sentient lightning\", although it does not show any signs of being truly electric in nature.\n\nBlueprints were found for all models from the S-1 to S-6 (the latter being in early prototyping stages, and not yet functional), but it proved impossible to truly recreate them. Fortunately, over 30,000 ready-made S-5 units were stockpiled deeply inside the ruined facility in \cfSunkaeze\c-, all ready for use. Currently, \cfTach-Engine Technologies\c- and its associated partners manage the distribution of these units, and are also studying the weapons in detail for potential redesigns and enhancements.\n\nOne notable detail about the Biospark Carbine is how its \"sentient\" energy drives shot projectiles to seek nearby targets, somehow telling apart friend from foe, relative to the weapon's user. Arcs of lightning have a tendency to spread out from them, dealing additional damage.\n\n\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Small blobs of stabilized energy with slight target-seeking abilities.

Its magenta tint comes from its various parts having been \"enriched\" with a mixture of \cfExplodium\c-, strawberry flavored hard caramel and pop rocks, including the ammunition itself. Somehow, this odd combination has resulted in the weapon's typical explosive yield to become a deadly fireworks show with each shot. Not only that, but the fact that the weapon itself also contains Explodium makes it, on its own, quite dangerous for the user, should they accidentally hit it against something, therefore the gun is quite unpopular among the public, making its price skyrocket.\n\n\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Single shots of explosive sweetness. A direct hit should be lethal on most targets, but if they somehow don't drop dead from that, the additional crackles and pops might do the deed, or spread the damage to nearby targets, too.\n\n\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Perform an \"explosive reload\", just like with a standard Explodium Gun. Note that unlike its weaker counterpart, the yield is much more extreme. It is best practice to always have one spare magazine at the ready for the reload, so you aren't left with an unusable weapon should your throw miss the target.\n\n\cfCombo Fire:\c- During the first moments of preparing an explosive reload, you can opt to, instead, leave the magazine in the gun, armed and ready, then throw the whole weapon as a grenade, for the ultimate destruction.

She's the second child of \cfDevai Unissix\c- and \cfSerwand Nerukousei\c-, being the younger sister of \cfDeneva Unissix\c-, one of the most renowned warriors in the entire nation.\n\nDue to being a child of mixed blood (as her father is not Devanikan, but rather a \"Chimera\", a term used to describe people born artificially through alchemical means), Misa was often shunned by members of other clans, who would describe her as a \"crossbred monstrosity\", and accuse her father of polluting the Unissix bloodline with nefarious intentions. Her sister would receive the same treatment, but was much more capable of ignoring it, while Misa however suffered a great deal during her whole life.\n\nOne thing that set her apart from her sister, was that she was much less physically capable, being \"too weak\" and \"not suited to be a dragonblood warrior\", it was noted too that unlike her brethren, she could not perform a dragon form summoning, either. All of this would also be used against her by the people who regularly bullied her. Her family eventually decided for her to always stay indoors, shut off from the outside world. It was through this that she eventually found her main hobby: Smithing.\n\nMisa found great enjoyment in creating all sorts of armor and weaponry, which would then be used by her family, or sold to other clans (who did not know who made them, but were very impressed by the quality), this was the beginning of \cfUnissix Crafts\c-, her little workshop/store. Expressing her creativity through it helped a lot to keep her thoughts away from all that was happening outside, and she felt much more relaxed.\n\nWith time, and as she kept improving her skills, she found interest in greater challenges, such as far more complex weaponry than mere blades and others. To satisfy this desire, her family would bring to her books on \"weapons of legend\", which the young Misa managed to replicate almost to perfection, much to the surprise of all. She was quite proud of what she had achieved, and this further boosted her popularity, which resulted in personal requests for many of those replicas to be made.\n\nIn 2016, the Unissix Clan received the visit of a \cfNukuri\c- woman, \cfZanaveth Nekuraku II\c-, who wished to study their culture and history. She was welcomed to stay at their home for as long as she wanted, as it was quite rare for them to have any visitors, and they were also intrigued by this individual from a species they had never seen before. During her stay, she'd eventually get to meet Misa, and would frequently watch her work. Misa initially felt quite shy around this odd white-as-snow woman who had appeared so suddenly, but as the days passed, and they got to interact more, they became quite close.\n\nOne morning, Misa's parents were given some surprising news. Zanaveth II wished to marry their daughter, and bring her to her homeworld, citing that she'd be much safer by her side. They very happily agreed to this proposition, and thanked her for what she had done. Ever since that day, Misa has never left Zanaveth II's side, always being with her, wherever she went. In 2042, during a stay on Earth with a mutual friend, the two had a child, \cfZanaveth Nekuraku III\c-.\n\nAlthough Misa was quite happy living with her wife, there was a major issue that popped up once she had moved in to \cfNahkami\c- with her: Her identity. Around that time, the \cfYathai Empire\c- was known to have a very negative \cf[ed. note: more like \"murdery\"]\c- stance on what the emperor saw as \"degeneracy\". Knowing that Misa would potentially be executed just like other members of family had been in the past, Zanaveth II had to ensure that the fact her wife was transgender was kept secret, much to her discomfort, having to then publicly present as male to the whole world, and additionally being unable to receive any treatment.\n\nIn 2068, When WW7 broke out, the two, along with their child, took the chance to flee to \cfSankaideriha\c-, the island of magic. There, Zanaveth II introduced Misa to a certain alchemist, \cfArchmage Kounan\c-, who was famous for providing what was known popularly as \"magic-based HRT\". For Misa, this was nothing short of miraculous, as in a matter of minutes, she would find herself in a body she could call her own, all solely by drinking one potion.\n\nMisa and her wife stayed in the island until 2108, when they were notified about the end of the war, along with the fall of the empire, and the rise of a more fair and welcoming society. These were wonderful news for them, and after saying their goodbyes to the people of the land of magic, they returned home. Ever since then, and with Zanaveth II being elected as \"Minister of Interspecies Relations\", the two now travel around the world together.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfWehhhhhh, Misa-Misa, you damn cutie...\c-\n\n\cfShe really is the sweetest lil' cinnamon roll, I tell ya.

Right next to Zana-sama they're both a full combo of maximum cuteness.\c-\n\n\cfIt's kinda sad to read on how things used to be a long time ago, but at the same time I'm also really happy that everything got better for them. Bless Zana-sama with that timely rescue there, like, from what I heard, all that awful bullying was REALLY getting to her, poor thing. Zana-sama talks about it a lot, the night she confessed to her, and how she begged for her to take her away from that hellhole. She's a goddamn angel, that gal.\c-\n\n\cf*sigh* You know, I'm kind of a sucker for romantic stories like these (don't tell anyone pls).\c-\n\n\cfOh yeah, also Misa is one hell of a pro gamer, holy shit. Anything I got her to play, she would just blaze through like it was nothing. Yeah, even THOSE games. It's fun to watch her, and she's specially fond of adventure stuff, I guess because it's the kinda thing she could never do irl.\c-\n\n\cfAlso, funny story. The first time I visited them when they were in Sankaideriha, Misa gave me one hell of a scare with that sudden transformation she went through. It's like... she was a completely different person entirely. Like, I had never seen her so happy before, it was really something else, and honestly I was also happy for her too. Ah, and then that other thing happened, when uhhh... we went to a hot springs together. I... accidentally... saw... down there, yeah...\c-\n\n\cfGod, no wonder I could hear Zana-sama across the house when they'd go at it. Ah... you lucky devil...\c-\n\n\cfYes, that was when they were staying at my place. They're not the first I hear do it like wild beasts, actually. Yu-chan and that big tiddy goth gf of hers, they're quite something too. Seriously, no one knows that from my bedroom you can perfectly hear whatever's happening in the guest room.

He was wearing an eyepatch and all, and I was told that the wound was actually incurable??? What the fuck were those hunters using? I get now why this shit happened, at least. Well, that, and I also learned of the reason why he was there in the first place.\c-\n\n\cfSee, this links back to your very first mission, Demo-chan. You know, the actual reason why Hell decided to go all murdery on us. Apparently Anthon had been sent there at the request of someone from Hell's royal family, to attempt to bring back a missing heir. THAT missing heir, the one that, had he not been fucking lost, would have prevented the whole uprising and demon invasion and shit.\c-\n\n\cfYeah, so I hate the UAC even more now. They may have gone by a different name, but same shit. I hope those fucks get what they deserve.\c-";

It is a direct improvement of the Mark 2 model, the \cfHellrazer\c-, being much easier to reload thanks to its simple drum magazine system.

Quite useful in tight spaces, where this scorching hot plasma won't dissipate as quickly, thoroughly roasting any targets within.\n\n\cf\"Slayer\" warheads:\c- A returning favorite from the previous series. These miniature nukes contain within themselves highly enriched Ardent Energy that will cause total devastation in a large radius, bringing swift death to even the highest ranked demons in Hell's armies.\n\nThe Hellblazer was discontinued following the destruction of the Imanaki Corp headquarters in 2009, but the \cfTach-Engine Technology Institute\c- had managed to reproduce this weapon following their demise. Replicated models do not actually employ this \"Ardent Energy\" however, so they are not as destructive as they were meant to be. Rather, they are powered by the highly volatile \cfNokron\c-, one of the two exotic elements involved in the process of Microfusion, as its potential for use in explosives is quite notable.\n\n\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Shoots the loaded ammunition with its propulsion armed and ready.\n\n\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Lobs the loaded ammunition unarmed, as a bouncing grenade.\n\n\cfTertiary Fire:\c- Cycles the ammo type for the next reload.\n\n\cfReloading:\c- During a reload, you may either refill the current mag (quite easy through the \cfHammerspace™\c- container), or swap it out for a different ammo type.\n\n\cfTechniques:\c- The grenades will automatically detonate on proximity to hostile targets, so you may still land the shot even if you merely grazed them. It is unclear how exactly they detect the targets, or know that they are hostile.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cf\"Ardent Energy\"? What's that? Energy extracted from a demon's ass after it ate too much curry? Whatever, anything coming from Hell is best left untouched, y'know. Just look at what happened to the fucking UAC, going around sticking their paws where they shouldn't.\c-\n\n\cfActually, making the replicas use Nokron was a pretty clever thing.

Having finished high school with excellent grades, he went on to study at many prestigious universities across the world, fueled by the desire to expand his knowledge, especially that of computer technology, which he was infatuated with. Alongside \cfSaya\c-, his younger sister, they founded \cfAkari Labs\c-, a company that specializes in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, among others. There, Taro's specialties are Software Engineering and Design, and he's also in charge of managing public relations, due to Saya not being \"much of a people person\" unlike him.\n\nTaro is a highly skilled programmer, proficient in several languages, and has quite a lot of projects to his name, along with many contributions to notable open source projects, including the \cfLinux Kernel\c-. He's also a self-proclaimed \"culture archivist\", noting that he's basically a walking library when it comes to aspects of popular culture that for most are lost to time, thanks to the immortality inherited from his mother, and his strong memory.

Following the tracking signal of her collar, he easily located her, and was about to take her back to Japan when a young girl approached him.

Out of all these strictly private designs, one sole weapon was eventually made public, the \cfWallbuster\c-, a 25-barrel revolving shotgun, chambered in 10Ga, and said to be capable of \"cleanly breaching through a barrier of pure lead half a meter thick\".\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfYeah, yeah.

Having been raised and homeschooled entirely within \cfEientei\c- she did not know much of the outside world, and would have spent the rest of her immortal life there, had it not been for a chance encounter with \cfRyuji Miyamoto\c- in the 60's. Having fled the \cfHuman Village\c-, he came across Nana. The two became close friends, and the young boy made a promise to marry her when he grew up, and take her outside, so she could \"see the world\". This would happen in 1973, with the two leaving Gensokyo to form a family of their own.\n\nBeing related to royalty, Nana has become quite famous on Japan, even appearing on several talk shows. She is also well known for her skills in several martial arts, and has won many tournaments over the years. Other hobbies of hers include painting and woodworking, and she's also a very fine cook.\n\nNana has three children, who, like her, have also inherited the immortal blood of the moon princess: \cfTaro\c-, \cfSaya\c- and \cfYui\c-.

Akin to typical particle-beam weaponry, but with a boost of thundering, highly destructive exotic matter, it has been deemed far superior even to the mighty \cfThunder Buster\c- so well-prized by UAC troops.\n\nUnexpectedly, the Rail Carbine is a tube fed bolt-action rifle, which employs shielded rods of pure \cfDysedum\c-. Each of these allowing the weapon to discharge guided 20kA pulses towards an ionized target, frying it in an instant, and potentially spreading its deadly effects to others nearby.\n\n\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Hold to emit a faint ionizing charge towards the aimed spot. The longer this is held, the more accurate the shot will be. Release to discharge the beam. If the rod has been depleted, cycle the bolt to load a new one.\n\n\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Also emits an ionizing charge, but does not discharge on release.

It was created as a lighter, more \"reasonable\" alternative to the 1.350 \cfBehemoth\c- model. Weighing 43 kilograms and sporting a total length of 2.4 meters, it is sufficiently compact for non-augmented human use.\n\nThe main ammunition designed for this specific model is the 1.150 \cfXSB (eXplosive Super Burst)\c-. These beastly rounds are partially based on a NATO standard 30x113mm cartridge, and employ a low density \cfExplodium\c- shaped charge as propellant, allowing high velocity while still being safe for use. The bullets themselves are composed of a tungsten carbide core, snugly wrapped in an aluminum jacket, and decorated with a thin silver plating for aesthetic appearance (Silver Bullets are, indeed, NOT really made of silver). XSB rounds can penetrate several targets before eventually stopping, depending on their size, they may also do the same for thin walls.\n\nThe secondary ammunition is the 1.150 \cfFCB (Fat Chode Bomb)\c-. Personally named by the CEO of Blackmann Arms himself, FCBs are quite similar to the standard XSB ammunition, but instead the bullets are full of additional Explodium, which on impact, is released violently, propagating its deadly blast through solid surfaces. Due to the volatility of these bullets, the propellant employed is slightly less potent, which results in a diminished potential for target penetration, but the blast definitely compensates for this. The explosive charge is so powerful that it can break some walls to pieces.\n\nIn order to compensate for its massive recoil, the weapon redirects a part of the gasses from round ignition into a set of jet compensators designed by \cfForx Aeronautics\c-. Although partially cooled in the process, it is still hot enough to cause some damage to users not wearing adequate protection.\n\n\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Shoot the bullet. Any small targets hit by it are pretty much turned to paste. A second press after firing will chamber another round.\n\n\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Switches next reload between XSB and FCB ammunition, if available.\n\n\cfReloading:\c- Reloads the weapon. Each magazine holds 5 rounds. An extra round can also be kept chambered.\n\n\cfZoom:\c- Custom-tailored adjustable telescopic sight, up to 16x. Equipped with a soft foam covering to protect the user's face during scoped fire.\n\n\cfTechniques:\c- When going prone to use the bipod, the recoil compensators will automatically disengage, resulting in increased firepower at the cost of less mobility.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfWhat was that quote again, \"there is no kill like overkill\"? Yeah, sounds about right for this thing.\c-\n\n\cfThe fuck are you even supposed to hunt with it, wild tanks?

At your fingertips, you have the power to call forth freezing flames that will turn your enemies into pretty ice statues in mere seconds.\n\n\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Releases a continuous stream of Blackfire, with moderate range. The flames not only rapidly freeze whatever they touch, but also reduce the air temperature, leaving a lingering freeze effect.\n\n\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Concentrated bursts that form spears of supercooled air which can impale small targets, or tear right through them.\n\n\cfReloading:\c- Attach a canister to replenish the weapon's internal dark mana reserves. The canister will remain locked in until it's been emptied, otherwise residual energy could escape it and bring harm to the user. If there is an empty canister attached, a second reload action will detach it. Fresh canisters can still be used even if the tank is full, and they will act as an extra \"buffer\" of mana until depleted.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfSo yeah, Misa-Misa has other toys besides that one bigass gun.

This oddity of all women in her family sharing the same name can be traced back to \cfElena Yanikov I\c-, born in 1703, who made this decision, out of some superstitious belief that it would \"preserve their immortality forever\". This was not far off from the truth, however, but it had nothing to do with inheritance of names. It has been verified that \cfAnarukon\c- genes are fully preserved across all female descendants, no matter how many generations, especially so for those from the Yanikov lineage.\n\nFrom a young age she showed quite the interest in \"exploring\" every corner of the city, first starting with just nearby abandoned buildings, then further expanding to pretty much any point of interest she could identify in the whole city. She began recording her urban explorations while still in elementary school, and uploading them to video sharing sites, earning quite a lot of popularity.\n\nIn the aftermath of the \cfWhite Scar\c-, Ellen used the skills she had gained in exploration to work as a scavenger alongside her mother, scouring the wasteland for valuable resources to bring back to the various shelters in the area. Through this she eventually met \cfIbuki Miyamoto\c-, the \cfRed Oni\c-, who had wandered the wastes for many years, becoming a \"legendary warrior\" of sorts due to her various feats. In the process of Ibuki being recalled back to Japan by \cfTaro Miyamoto\c-, of \cfAkari Labs\c-, Ellen decided that she wanted to go with them, citing that \"wandering around this dump is really boring anyway and I really want to see the world out there\".\n\nDuring her stay in Japan, she'd often spend her time with Taro, the two of them eventually dating some weeks after. Something which was followed by an announcement from Taro on social media citing: \"my wizard privileges have been revoked\".\n\nApart from her shared ancestry with renowned Gothic Rock singer/guitarist \cfAshley Knox\c-, she also shares a much closer relation to her due to the fact her father is the grandson of Ashley's ex-husband, the late \cfFredrik Steiner\c-. Through this, and the fact they both are engaged to members of the Miyamoto family, they have become quite close. Ellen has even considered joining the band at some point, though as of this article's writing, this hasn't yet happened.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfHeh, typical of Taro nii-san, announcing to the whole damn world that he lost his fucking virginity. He really couldn't be any more subtle about it if he tried. So yeah, between him and Yu-chan, the two have scored themselves some immortal cuties, making me jealous as all fuck in the process.

It quickly became the main provider of weaponry for the \cfYathai Empire\c-, which secured the Nekuraku family's position among the \"high class\" citizens of the Empire. With this new status, Zanata even managed to secure a position as provincial leader of Akai, one of the largest and richest in \cfNahkami\c-. With this absolute dominion of that region, Nekuratek would extend itself with practically no limits, thus becoming the largest corporation on the planet.\n\nZanata remained at the head of the company until 1870, after a malfunction in Nekuratek's first \cfNokorokinylum Fusion Reactor\c- prototype resulted in an explosion that took her life and those of several other workers. Following the suicide of Zanata's husband, and with their two children, \cfDokuro\c- and \cfNokoi\c- having died in WW6, the only potential successor that remained was her granddaughter, \cfZanata II\c-.\n\nOnce in charge of Nekuratek, Zanata II began to diversify into other fields, such as robotics and information technology, and gradually cut down on the fabrication of weaponry. It was not clear at first, the reason for this sudden change in direction, but following the fall of the Yathai Empire, she eventually revealed her long time disdain for the tyrannical regime, and her wish to distance herself and her family from \"being architects of death\".\n\nDuring the initial period of \"deescalation\", her son \cfZanaveth I\c- had been in charge of the arms manufacturing division, and was responsible for the creation of \cfThe Emperor's Wrath\c-, a low orbit weapon that would be used in the events of the \cfWhite Scar\c- incident. After having witnessed what his creation had done, he resigned from his position and spent several years in solitude. He never involved himself with the company ever since.\n\nDuring the massive overhaul to the political and economic systems of the nation in the period of transition of 2104-2108, Nekuratek was one of the very first to reform itself into a publicly owned organization, with the Nekuraku family serving merely as \"symbolic leaders\". In 2128, Zanata II retired and left \cfZanaveth II\c- in charge of the company.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfGreat people to work with (even back during their old \"unchecked capitalism\" phase), tbh.

Chambered in .50 BMG, and feeding directly off \cfHammerspace™\c-, this puppy can be carried anywhere without the need to bring along hefty ammo boxes. Additionally, powered by \cfTach-Engine\c-'s \"Magdalene\" Microfusion battery, the weapon can stay in operation for several days without needing to recharge.\n\nWhile generally meant for mounted use, on-the-go operation is possible, provided the user is equipped with silver-rated power armor at minimum in order to handle its heavy recoil.\n\n\cfPrimary Fire:\c- 1050 RPM operation. Sustained fire in this mode is theoretically endless, as the heat produced can be efficiently nullified by the internal cooling systems, it is therefore the recommended mode for most situations.\n\n\cfSecondary Fire:\c- 2100 RPM operation. Twice the amount of bullet, but with far more heat. Sustained fire in this mode may trigger the weapon's safety lock should the rising heat bring the weapon too close to non-operational temperature.\n\n\cfTertiary Fire:\c- 1260 RPM three-shot mode. Though it would be perceived as 420 RPM, each fired shot is actually three rounds in tandem. The heat output of this mode is quite high, however, so it is not well recommended for extended use.\n\n\cfReloading:\c- There is absolutely no need whatsoever to reload this weapon, as it feeds directly off Hammerspace, requiring only a large supply of ammunition. Hammerspace containers will automatically link all necessary rounds for tethered feeding.\n\n\cfTechniques:\c- Sustained secondary fire while aiming downwards can propel you, if you're crazy enough to do that.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfHEAVY MAH-SHEEN GUN!!!\c-\n\n\cfI don't care if Nerdboi made this, I don't care if this is a reference to what I can tell it is, I love it, it's good, perfect for my severe thirst for dakka, and I'm sure yours too.

It is well known that Imanaki Corp engaged in interdimensional travel experiments, specifically to the realm of \cfHell\c-. Much was studied of that world, and with the knowledge gained of their research, the corporation would then delve into the combination of Demon and Human technology. It was not known exactly how they got the technology for interdimensional travel in the first place, until documents from the \cfFaculty of Illuminated Nobodies\c- were discovered in late 2099 showing their collaboration, and that most of this technology was of \cfXevetha\c- origin, just like the \cfSUSAN\c- AI.\n\nFollowing an incident where some of the town's local ghouls attempted to attack the installations, Imanaki Corp contacted the \cfUAAF\c- in order to request armed defense. When the man they sent to negotiate their contract arrived at the town, he was murdered on sight by one of the ghouls. This prompted the UAAF to immediately send soldiers to the area, in order to exterminate those creatures, as it seemed that they maybe were more hostile than they expected. This \"hunt\" for the ghouls started in mid-2007, and lasted for two whole years, as the entirety of the town and its surroundings were thoroughly combed and every single encountered creature was exterminated, except for one.\n\nThe very last ghoul they encountered proved to be much more resilient than all the others, taking many lives with it as it caused an immense fire within the Nuskar forest. The locals had warned them that this was no ordinary monster, but something much more powerful that they could never defeat. It took many days to weaken that lone ghoul, and when finally they attempted to go for the killing blow, a man approached the soldiers, and stood between them and the downed beast. He was definitely not one of the locals, and the language he spoke could not be identified by anyone. Despite being ordered to step aside, he did not move, pointing at the soldiers and shouting at them. They eventually decided to open fire on him. This was one of the biggest mistakes humanity would ever make.\n\nThat man was none other than \cfPrince Anthon Anderken\c-, one of the most important members of \cfAnarukon\c- royalty, who had, by sheer chance, come to Earth in order to seize that one specific ghoul, for undetermined reasons, at the same exact moment the hunt had started. After being shot down, the ghoul became enraged, and used the last of its strength to engulf everyone in blazing fire. The roar of this explosion of blinding flame was heard all over the world. None of the soldiers survived, as the whole forest was reduced to ashes in an instant. It is unknown what happened to Anthon or the ghoul, but most would assume they both survived.\n\nAfter this rather spectacular incident, Imanaki Corp resumed their operations, now freed from the threat of the ghouls, although they faced much criticism from the locals for their decision to destroy what they deemed a \"national treasure\". This relative peace would not last long, however, as the consequences of the attack on Anthon would eventually catch up to them. In December of 2009, before yet another routine expedition to Hell, their portals were hijacked by an unidentified attacker, and from them, a swarm of Anarukon soldiers sprung forth, annihilating everyone they'd find within the installations and their surroundings. The Imanaki Corp building was completely destroyed, and the Anarukon forces remained in the town for many days, before eventually returning to their world, satisfied with the destruction they had caused in retaliation.\n\nSome time after these events, a small recon team managed to salvage some of the research material and other documents from the ruins, which would later fall into the hands of the \cfUAC\c-.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfI've talked about the ghoul hunt stuff in another entry, so I won't go into detail here, but yeah, would you look at that.

The city also hosts a variety of places of study, along with several shops, these serving as its main source of income.\n\nThe city is led by the \cfHigh Tribunal of Witches\c-, of which LS is part of, along with other witches of renown, such as \cfKana Sankai\c-, head of the \cfCounter-Inquisition\c-, the city's main military force who serve not just to protect the city itself, but also magic users living abroad who are endangered by anti-mage persecutors, and \cfSaniuke Okusainaya\c-, who is well known for being the first \cfNukuri\c- technomancer, successful in bridging the gap between the arcane and the modern.\n\nThe main way in and out of Sankaideriha is a very well-guarded secret among its inhabitants, essentially making it an \"invitation only\" location. Nonetheless, any skilled mage can simply create a portal to it as needed.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfI've been there with Ashley-san a couple times. It's SUPER PRETTY, seriously.

During his early teens, he became quite rebellious, desiring to leave the village and have \"adventures\". One day, he fled, and got himself lost in the bamboo forest surrounding \cfEientei\c-. There, he came across \cfNana\c-, the daughter of \cfKaguya Houraisan\c-, and the two became friends. After guiding him back to the village, Ryuji promised her that he'd return one day, to marry her, and take her with him to see the outside world.\n\nRyuji and Nana made their \"escape\" in 1973, and settled in the city of Kasukabe, where the two formed a family, starting with their first son, \cfTaro\c- in 1985, who would be followed later on by \cfSaya\c- in 1993 and \cfYui\c- in 2009.\n\nWhile working a typical office job to support the family, Ryuji would additionally have one notable hobby on the side, as an \"inventor\". He would often come up with all sorts of clever tools and machines to help make work around the house easier, and would even get extra money selling some of them to neighbors. His skills gradually improved with time, every year rising one step further in their complexity and scale. Earning him fame throughout the whole city.\n\nOne of his most notable achievements is the very house the Miyamoto family lives in. By 2015, their old house was completely reconstructed into a high security underground facility, that would keep the family safe from any catastrophe that might happen to the world. This initial underground home was later expanded even further, as the company formed by Saya and Taro, \cfAkari Labs\c-, kept growing. And as of this article's writing, it is large enough to host most of the workforce of the company.\n\nIn 2035, seeing that Akari Labs was pulling in more money than he ever could, he decided to retire early and take a back seat, watching over his children and their work.\n\nRyuji unfortunately passed away in 2054, after being unable to recover from a stroke he suffered during a daily jog. This came as a surprise, as he was known to be in good health, despite being 98 at the time, in his words, having reached such an age thanks to \"leading a healthy and happy lifestyle\". After a long period of mourning, Nana brought his ashes to Gensokyo and spread them in the bamboo forest surrounding Eientei, where the two had first met.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfHe was the best dad, and I learned so much from him, and he was always super happy to see me get interested in inventing things just like him. He was really proud of us, and worked a lot so we could get to where we are now. Akari Labs... it would have never existed if it wasn't for dad.\c-\n\n\cfUgh, thinking back to those days, it really is no good, damn it.

Of the many other weapons \cfBlackmann Arms\c- has made for him, this is the only one that was made public, and it's said that the others may be even more ludicrous.\n\nThe internal mechanisms driving this weapon have such a degree of complexity that they've been described as \cf\"Kraut Deep Space Magic\"\c- by some. Only \cfHermann E. Ischer\c- himself knows every detail about their operation. With each twist of the main trigger, the topmost barrel is primed, and then its group spins counter-clockwise, with the next round ready for shooting. Every five shots, or when the secondary trigger is used, the main body spins afterwards, switching to another five-barrel group.\n\nThe Wallbuster is compatible with most standard types of ammunition, although there are safety restrictions on some, including incendiary types, and golden shells. This limits the range of ammunition usable to only these four types: Buckshot, Slug, Saltshot, Lead Ball.\n\n\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Shoots the barrel at the top.\n\n\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Shoots the 5-barrel group at the top.\n\n\cfTertiary Fire:\c- Shoots all barrels, if you really want to.\n\n\cfReloading:\c- Once the side lever is pulled down, the barrel groups can be safely detached and reloaded individually. For reloading on the go, it's recommended to have a \cfMagnetic Utility Belt\c- or similar at hand, as it will make this operation easier. Speed loaders are available for purchase from the Blackmann Arms website, or from authorized distributors.\n\n\cfTechniques:\c- True to its name, you can destroy all sorts of obstacles along the way, provided you're dealing enough damage relative to their size. This even includes locked doors, so you won't have to bother with key hunting anymore.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfOK so, this ballbusting hunk of metal.

An emergency message was sent from the Moon, overtaking all video and radio signals. It was the announcement of an alien species making their presence known. The full transcript is as follows:\n\n\cf\"This is a message for all of humankind. We are the Nukuri. For thousands of years we have observed you, studied you, while in hiding. We were to ensure absolute secrecy, and avoid influencing your developments in any way, until the time was right for our first contact. However, the current circumstances call for this contact to happen much sooner than we had planned. Your world is in immediate danger of ultimate destruction, and we shall not stand still and watch. Do not fear, the threat will be dealt with soon. May the stars shine bright on you.\"\c-\n\nFollowing the announcement, SUSAN's countdown to destruction was halted, and control of Russia's missile systems was reestablished. The \cfNukuri\c- had somehow remotely neutralized the AI at its core, as nothing could truly be observed by the units stationed right outside the range of its self-defense systems, the whole structure simply shut itself down.\n\nShortly after, and over many days, regular communications with the Nukuri would happen. Many questions would be answered, such as their origins (a remote solar system called \cfXathar\c-, located in the Andromeda galaxy), how long had they been studying us (since 1309 BC), and if they were peaceful (to this last one, there was a long pause before getting a simple \"yes\", which raised some concerns).\n\nOn May 11th of 2021, an alliance between humans and Nukuri was finally signed, after the first reunion of \cfEmperor Ledora Yathai\c- with the leaders of the major nations of Earth. By the end of the year, many among the Nukuri had already made themselves at home in our planet, most coming from the \cfLuna Research Institute for Human Studies\c-, who desired to have a more in-depth experience of our culture.\n\nIn addition, the alliance provided humanity with a major boost in technological development, thanks to their various advances and knowledge being made available to us. Among other things, the Nukuri put a lot of effort into making their own computer technology compatible with ours, resulting in the powerful \cfNekern Architecture\c-. They also helped alleviate the struggles for clean energy by introducing us to the \cfNokorokinylum Microfusion Engine\c-, a method of cold fusion requiring little space and equipment, but also rather exotic elements (which are thankfully easily available in their homeworld).\n\nThese major changes also brought the attention of other species, neighbors of the Nukuri, who also showed interest in us. Humanity was made aware of just how, despite the vast emptiness of it all, the universe has much more life in it that one could have imagined. Plans had been made, for Earth to become part of the so-called \cfX'Animen Coalition\c-, an interplanetary association the Nukuri were part of.\n\nHowever, it all came to a sudden end when, in June of 2073, \cfWorld War 3\c- began.

Even us, with our damn anti-apocalypse bunker of a house. There was no way that we'd survive what that thing was going to do, practically setting off all the fucking nukes it could reach at once. And then THAT happened, kind of cliched af to be done right at the very last moment, a fucking heroic save like that. Bet they did it on purpose to look cool, heh.\c-\n\n\cfAnyway, life was good back then, with all those Nukuri cuties hanging out with us. You could see so many of them in the street, and well, that was also when I met Zana-sama too, best goddamn Christmas gift of my life, heh. Really REALLY miss those days, you know, pretty much hanging out with her every weekend or so. Nowadays, life just plain sucks, and I can only ever get the chance to like, send and get messages super-rarely by passing them through the Lunar Embassy (when those stupid-ass rabbits actually do their jobs).\c-\n\n\cfI really wish things would go back to how they used to be. I mean, sure, since our country didn't sign the bullshit White Scar treaty we can still use their tech, but they can't come here themselves, nor are we allowed to go there either. Fuck all that shit.\c-";

These ruins had somehow remained undiscovered by the \cfNukuri\c-, despite their constant usage of the portal to travel between their system and ours.

No side effects of any kind have been found, despite many years of frequent use. \n\nOnce the carrier holds the artifact tightly against their body, the glow from within the artifact will gradually fade, as it emits some unspecified form of \"energy\" that rapidly heals nearby wounds.

As the stories go, this \"tyrant god\" was assassinated by one of his most trusted associates, in a suicidal attack that resulted in the massive crater that reaches deep into the planet's frozen core. Very few survived, who still live to this day, and witness accounts are rather bare.\n\nIn 793 BC, an expedition by \cfDevanikan\c- adventurers resulted in the discovery of several artifacts at the very bottom of this crater. These were the so-called \cfArtifacts of Nedoshiaan\c-, a set of weapons devised by the dictator god himself and created by his loyal engineer \cfNukurines Mei Mess\c-, who among others had all survived this incident and no longer wished to associate themselves with it. These artifacts were immediately put under the protection of the \cfUnissix Clan\c-, and to this day they tightly control any research and reproduction of them.\n\nOnly four artifacts were found, of the five that had been allegedly constructed. It's widely accepted that this fifth artifact was the one responsible for the death of the deity, and had been lost in the process. The known artifacts are as follows:\n\n\cfMykradvo:\c- Also known as the \cfGreat Anomaly\c-, an orb of pure energy that, in the hands of a single individual, would allow them to smite all around them in an instant. Its power is, however, very limited, and a great deal of time is needed for it to recharge itself after use, making it more of a last resort weapon for emergencies.\n\n\cfKyshyje:\c- The \cfAmulet of Misfortune\c- that, when worn by an individual, would bring absolute destruction and madness to all those who desired to harm them. At least, that's what it was meant to do, as once tested, it appeared to instead attract misfortune to whoever wore it, perhaps as a sign of them not being \"worthy\" of wearing it, as some theorized.\n\n\cfYnykron:\c- Known by most as the \cfDeath Cannon\c-. One of two surviving artifacts that could be counted as an actual, physical weapon. Fueled by the \"essence of countless tortured souls\", it is capable of channeling it all into an unstoppable beam of energy that tears through space-time, erasing from existence anything it comes in contact with.\n\n\cfNekrodero:\c- One artifact that has been forbidden from ever being used, due to the very nature of its operation, and the effects it has on those who are struck by it. Details on what exactly it does are impossible to obtain, but it has been described as \"the most abhorrent display of cruelty that not even the most twisted of minds could have imagined\".\n\n\cfInshtrometanykha:\c- The fifth and missing artifact, the \cfGod Slayer\c-. Named this due to the fact this was the only known weapon that could actually destroy a god across the three layers of existence. Its effectiveness is very clear, taking into account what happened. Only two deities survived the blast, having been just grazed by it, however one became unable to take on a physical form, requiring an artificial body, and the other suffered severe damages that have put them in a \"deep sleep\".\n\nOf these artifacts, the \cfYnykron\c- was successfully reproduced and re-engineered for more \"mundane\" use, after \cfMisa Unissix\c- obtained its original blueprints from Mei Mess himself. Its usage still is very strictly controlled, of course.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfDictator gods, weapons of ultimate destruction, \"fueled by tortured souls\"... This shit's crazy, seriously.

She's quite an empathetic and sociable person, completely unlike her relatively gloomier, more reclusive older sister and brother \cfSaya\c- and \cfTaro\c-, having always shown a clear interest in helping other people. Since her childhood, her wish had been to become a doctor, \"to save lives\". This wish came to fruition after persevering through her studies, and many years slowly \"ascending the ranks\". As of this article's writing, Yui currently works as a neurosurgeon at \cfKasukabe Central Hospital\c-, and has received several awards for her outstanding achievements.\n\nOn a more personal side, Yui has a wide variety of interests, which some have noted as amusing in how contrasting they can be. For example, she's known to be an avid fan of wrestling, but she's just as crazy about it as she is for chess. She also enjoys various types of music that would normally be felt as \"conflicting\" with each other. Truly, Yui Miyamoto is a woman of contrasts. \cf[ed. note: thanks, spat all over my keyboard here]\c-\n\nFor a long time, Yui had been a fan of a certain British band, \cfThe Black Rat's Coven\c-. She really enjoyed their music, and was absolutely enamored with the lead singer, \cfAshley Knox\c-. She often fantasized about dating her, much to the mockery of her friends, and truly, seriously wished one day she'd show up at her door, asking her to be her girlfriend.\n\nAll of this was clearly never going to happen, and she knew it, but one day, the band visited Japan during one of their tours, and she got to see them live. Yui and her sister, who was also a fan, were quick to get tickets for the concert and head there as fast as they could. The experience was something else, being so close to them. Yui could swear that sometimes, Ashley would look at her and smile, but she dismissed it as probably being her imagination, or something.\n\nAfter the concert, she excitedly lined up to get an autograph, and that's when the impossible became possible. Once in front of the \cf\"Stylish Witch of the West\"\c-, Yui nervously asked her, but what she got instead were some words that left her frozen in place: \"You're a very cute gal. Wanna go out with me?\". Suffice to say, the two are now happily married.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfghfjksdhfsjkghsdkfjsfgj I was so happy for her but also JEALOUS, YES, VERY JEALOUS.

The existence of this project was kept completely secret until her public reveal in June of 2077. There was much controversy surrounding the Red Oni program, including Saya's personal involvement in it, having accepted a 40 billion USD payment in exchange for it (which was found to be related to Texas having been sold back to Mexico many weeks before). Despite her clear potential and outstanding combat abilities, she was deployed too late, as only moments later, the \cfWhite Scar\c- happened, and with it, the complete devastation of the \cfUnited States\c-.\n\nMany years after the incident, Ibuki was successfully retrieved from the scorched wastelands, having spent a long time as a sort of \"roaming mercenary\". She returned to Japan in June of 2091, and once settled in, began working odd jobs until finding her true vocation as a nude model.\n\nHaving been created from Saya's own DNA, she has effectively inherited the total immortality of the Miyamoto family, on top of this, further enhancements were performed which have given her increased strength and reflexes, along with effectively making her skin bulletproof. Saya has remarked that this last fact means she does not need to wear any clothing.\n\nAdditionally citing Saya's rather \"interesting\" decisions, there is the fact of her particular physical traits beyond those of her strength, including her blatantly obscene bust size, which some deem impractical, much to Saya's disagreement. When asked for further details, she went on a rather lengthy rant on Twitter about the subject of \"waifus\".\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfOK yes sure, I love giga-tiddies. But why does everyone have to call me out for it? Is there really ANYTHING wrong with that, huh? Yeah, thought so.\c-\n\n\cfSure, Ibuki was like, my biggest hornypost ever.

I ended up admitting to it being intentional, saying some random shit that came through my mind, like \"distraction tactics\" or something, I forgot. In the end they let it slide.\c-\n\n\cfOh yeah, did you know? Technically speaking, Ibuki is my clone. Yeah, there may have been some slight modifications, but if my growth hadn't stopped early, who knows, I could have looked that hot one day.

Its construction was finalized in 2018, and was then immediately activated, after which it began its mission to \"purify the world\" by hijacking Russia's nuclear missile systems (since they were the closest), then over time spreading its control further, reaching other major countries with nuclear weaponry. By the start of 2019 it had already assumed control of all nukes in the entire planet, and a broadcast began, announcing a countdown of three years before all weapons were armed and detonated in unison, bringing forth \"World Purification\".\n\nMany attempts were made to stop this rogue AI, but all failed. Its main structure, located off the coast of \cfKereshnovka\c- proved impenetrable, and any who approached would be swiftly eliminated by its weapons. It was clear that destroying it directly was an impossibility, but some suggested an alternative: Finding a way to \"counter-hack\" it. In mid-2020, a group of the world's most skilled hackers finally neutralized the AI, completely overtaking it. They were so successful, in fact, that they even managed to install various operating systems and programs freely, as it appeared to be based on the same architecture as any standard desktop computer. During many months, people celebrated, having prevented the extinction of all of mankind.\n\nAfter some analysis of files found in SUSAN, the masterminds behind this doomsday device could be tracked down and brought to justice: Doctor \cfDaniel Perkman\c-, a senior IT engineer at \cfImanaki Corp\c-; \cfHiroshi Yuramaki\c-, Dr. Perkman's assistant and \cfUmbrelle N. Owen\c- (assumed name), current lead of the Qurensniv branch of the FIN. During questioning, Ms. Owen managed to escape, and days later, SUSAN was rebooted and resumed its countdown, but this time, its internal security had been hardened, and all hope was lost for it to be stopped again.\n\nEarth could do nothing but stand in wait, watching the digits of the countdown drop, one by one, with the estimated \"purification\" being set for August of 2021. With only mere months left, there were mass panics, whole cities up in flames, it was chaos. But then, in February of 2021, something unexpected would happen: The \cfLuna Event\c-.\n\nA broadcast was sent from somewhere in the Moon. It was not of human origin, and it overtook all radio and television ranges. The \cfNukuri\c- were announcing their presence, having watched and studied us for countless years. They had remained neutral to all of our various conflicts, but this time they had seen that we were unable to overcome the upcoming disaster, so they would break their vow of non-intervention there and then. Only moments after the broadcast, in an instant, SUSAN was shut down completely, being struck by a blinding flash of light from above. It was clear that this alien race far surpassed us, if they could get rid of it that easily.\n\nIt was determined that truly destroying SUSAN would be excessively dangerous for the planet, so it merely remained there, as a massive piece of useless junk drifting around the Arctic Sea. Dismantling it could also be an option, but it would prove too expensive and time consuming of an ordeal.\n\nIn 2097, long after the events of \cfWorld War 3\c- and the \cfWhite Scar\c-, with the Nukuri race no longer allied to us and available to defend us, an unidentified alien entity arrived on Earth. A large, floating humanoid figure, clad in white robes and with the appearance of an old man, who announced himself to be \cfGod\c-. Many had a hard time believing such a thing, but others were quick to acknowledge that this was definitely the Abrahamic God himself descending onto Earth from the Heavens. \cf[ed. note: bunch of idiots is what they are]\c-\n\nAfter making his presence known all across the world, he then approached the deactivated SUSAN structure, and entered it. Those expecting that it would be destroyed were the ones most shocked by what happened next: It was reactivated, and once again resumed all its operations, this time with a much shorter countdown of two years. The words of the godly entity now resonated all over the world. Mankind had proven to be unworthy of walking the Earth, and it was his wish to undo it all, to wipe the planet and start anew, from a clean slate. We had previously interrupted his will, conducted through his most faithful followers, but this time he would not allow that to happen again. Those were his words, and once again, all went back to chaos.\n\nWounded by the previous war, and now having voluntarily discarded all their technological advances of Nukuri origin, along with cutting all contact with them, there was no chance to fight back. In the last moments of the countdown, the whole world was ready to accept death. What came at the end of this countdown was, however, not that, but something else entirely.\n\nWith a roaring shockwave that cleared the skies of the whole planet, a massive explosion erupted from atop SUSAN, expelling large pieces of its internal machinery into space. The cause of this explosion was unknown, but it happened just in time to prevent a much bigger disaster. Many days later, the charred remains of the alien entity were retrieved from the ruins of the megastructure. Many studies would be conducted on the biology of what was assumed to be a dead god.\n\nReligious groups all over the world condemned what was seen as \"the murder of God\" \cf[ed. note: these fucking people...]\c-, but they were all eventually silenced. In a post on social media, \cfMaruku Sarahabinaku\c- of the Gothic Rock band \cfBlack Rat's Coven\c- stated that \"the dead one is not one of us\", in response to an article on his autopsy. Questioned about the exact meaning of their response, Maruku would go on to reveal everything about his true nature. The \"false god\" was a man named \cfUruk'Anth\c-, and came from the \cfXevetha\c- race, who were infamous for their attempts to \"achieve artificial godhood\", furthermore, they added that if people wanted to see an actual god, \"you could have just talked to me\".\n\nThe reveal of Maruku Sarahabinaku as being an actual deity was followed by that of another member of the band, drummer \cfMykka Psyann\c-. She remarked on actually having known Uruk'Anth, back when he was \"a servant of the tyrant god\". Confusion and disbelief would intermix for a long time, but all eventually settled on accepting what had been said by these two individuals.\n\nSUSAN was finally dismantled in 2130 by the \cfUnion Aerospace Corporation\c-, who would go on to study its various components for potential \"beneficial applications\".\n\nEven though these events have all long passed, everyone remembers. The story of these incidents had not only shown us how easily and quickly all we had ever done could be destroyed, but also came with its two major revelations, one being that we are not alone in the universe, that many alien races exist out there, some peaceful, some hostile; and the other, that gods are more real and truer than anyone could have thought, and that some live among us, without us having ever realized.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfBig one, this article, huh? All this stuff happened waaaay back before you were even born, Demo-chan, but I thought it'd be good that you read up on it.\c-\n\n\cfIt's a pretty crazy story, I know, but it all happened. Don't really remember a lot of it, personally, it was veeeery long ago, heh. I do remember though that once thing, that when they hacked the big ol' machine, they put a fucking Minecraft server on it, and it could host a shitton of players without a hitch. They also tried running Crysis, and when they noticed that it ran too smoothly, they started 29 more instances of it, and it still kept being silky smooth. God that was such a fucking mess (and the MC server was still running btw).\c-\n\n\cfAnyway, won't rant more about things you're too young to understand. So yeah, this fucking thing came up and wanted to destroy us all, but with all that we learned that the Nukuri were there, and it was good, and then I met Zana-sama and we became friends, and all that... which obviously got fucking undone by the White Scar (ugh).\c-\n\n\cfAnd yeah, gods. Fucking... GODS. Real damn gods. I actually already knew those two from Ashley-san's band, so yeah, was also quick to have my doubts about that old geezer. Dude just pops up from nowhere looking like a stereotypical \"god of christianity\" and everything. Come on, that's just too fucking obvious.\c-\n\n\cfPS: Taro is currently seething in his seat. He can't stand religious crazery. Honestly, he'd be tipping his fedora if he had one.\c-";

Its first use was in the \cfExplodium Gun\c-, an easily portable \"pocket exploder\" that saw massive commercial success, allowing the company to climb the ranks of the world's top arms manufacturers, despite the fact that, had it not been for Parker's interests in weaponizing it, they would have never even considering entering that market, remaining solely as producers of smart appliances.\n\nThough generally regulated due to the dangers posed by its misuse, it's common knowledge that Explodium is also often sold in black markets, and may have even been employed in the creation of \"small bombs\", used in certain acts of terror and gruesome assassinations.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfFUCKING CALLED IT!

I went into full \"thousand apologies\" mode, just slamming onto the floor and everything. Kirin had to run up to us to explain things and get her to calm down because I was just... unable to do anything. Holy fuck, that...

That is, until around August of 2160, when two demonic necromancers, the \cfResurrector Sisters\c-, made their appearance, and brought back to life all those who had fallen, prompting the UAC to recommission their \"problem solver\" once again, who made his way back towards Hell, exterminating the revived demons and swiftly eliminating both of the Resurrector Sisters. Once his initial rampage was over, he sent one final message back to Earth, saying that he had sworn to remain in Hell forever, in order to ensure that the demons would never attempt to attack humanity ever again.\n\nThe Doom Marine spent his days fighting the remaining demon armies on Hell, eventually defeating all of the remaining commanders. Seeing that there was no way to stop this lone human's rampage, the archdemon generals devised a plan to instead \"make him leave\". When the marine entered the capital city of \cfDis\c-, with the clear intent to kill them, he fell straight into their trap. \cfErebus\c-, the leading general, took this opportunity to banish him, as far away as he could, far beyond even the outer limits of this Universe, so that he could never have a chance to return.\n\nDespite these massive losses, along with the return of Father Nostros, the archdemons still rule over Hell, as neither him nor the exiled royal family truly have the power to defeat them and restore peace. Their only hope is that of the eventual return of Manakei, who is the only demon strong enough to surpass all of the archdemon generals.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfOK, first of all, big thanks to Ellen-san's gramps for the info we could get on this.

SWWM_LORETXT_HELL3 = "\cxName:\c-\n\cf Hell\c-\n\cxClassification:\c-\n\cf Nether realm\c-\n\n\cfHell\c- is a vast world separate from our own, but still contained within our Universe. In its inception, it was known as \cfKur\c-, a peaceful world that the \cfAnarukon\c- people led out of \cfNovoskhana\c- by \cfNoskas Kurenai\c- had sought as the \"promised land\" where they would live in peace away from the tyranny of the \cfEternal Empress\c-. The peace lasted for almost three thousand years, until the \cfBetrayal of Father Nostros\c- happened in 10,675 BC, wherein one of the descendants of the \cfNine Kings\c- of Kur brought with himself a seemingly endless army of creatures who could only be described as \"demons\" and decided to take the whole land for himself and his new \"followers\". Ever since then, the land of Kur has become what can only be described as \"Hell\", under the reign of Nostros as its \"supreme leader\".\n\nIn 134, following the disappearance of prince heir \cfManakei\c-, who had been summoned to Earth but never returned, internal conflicts arose within the ranks of Hell's royalty. These fights for the succession of the throne, however, never truly escalated as long as Nostros was there to keep the demons at bay. Many attempts were made to locate the heir and bring him back, unsuccessfully.\n\nIn 2145, after the supreme leader of Hell suddenly left the throne for unexplained reasons, leaving only his son, the inexperienced \cfKing Akusei\c- in charge, the various archdemons, corrupt generals of the demon armies, took the chance to stage a coup and overthrow the main royal family, forcing them into exile. This event unfortunately coincided closely with the \cfUAC\c-'s first explorations of Hell. Although curious at first about these odd beings that had entered their realm, they made the decision of exterminating them once they began to show an interest in exploiting their natural resources and in addition had shown hostility when approached. They were almost successful in this, but their plans for sending a full fleet to our own world were swiftly stopped along with their initial invasion of \cfMars City\c-, and couldn't be truly realized until much later, in 2148, when they managed to hijack the UAC's teleporters on Phobos and Deimos, completely overtaking both moon bases and even managing to pull in one of the two moons into their own realm. Following retaliation from a lone soldier, the \cfDoom Marine\c-, they set their sights on Earth, bringing forth all of their legions, under the command of \cfBaramun\c-, the Titan of the East, who was given the title of \cfIcon of Sin\c-.\n\nAgainst all odds, humanity prevailed, and the invaders were defeated, along with their leader. Despite this major defeat, the demon generals organized several other attacks, using their remaining forces, but failed once more. Having realized that humanity was far more resilient than they could ever have imagined, they gave up. That is, until around August of 2160, when two demonic necromancers, the \cfResurrector Sisters\c-, made their appearance, and brought back to life all those who had fallen, prompting the UAC to recommission their \"problem solver\" once again, who made his way back towards Hell, exterminating the revived demons and swiftly eliminating both of the Resurrector Sisters. Once his initial rampage was over, he sent one final message back to Earth, saying that he had sworn to remain in Hell forever, in order to ensure that the demons would never attempt to attack humanity ever again.\n\nThe Doom Marine spent his days fighting the remaining demon armies on Hell, eventually defeating all of the remaining commanders. Seeing that there was no way to stop this lone human's rampage, the archdemon generals devised a plan to instead \"make him leave\". When the marine entered the capital city of \cfDis\c-, with the clear intent to kill them, he fell straight into their trap. \cfErebus\c-, the leading general, took this opportunity to banish him, as far away as he could, far beyond even the outer limits of this Universe, so that he could never have a chance to return.\n\nDespite these massive losses, along with the return of Father Nostros, the archdemons still rule over Hell, as neither him nor the exiled royal family truly have the power to defeat them and restore peace. Their only hope is that of the eventual return of Manakei, who is the only demon strong enough to surpass all of the archdemon generals.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfOK, first of all, big thanks to Ellen-san's gramps for the info we could get on this. Cytho-sama is like, our only contact with that fucking place, and you won't even believe the things he's told me.\c-\n\n\cfFor example, did you know that not everyone in there is \"the root of all evil\"? Obviously, there's all those bloodthirsty demons that blindly follow the generals and are hellbent (heh) on bringing death and suffering, but... there's also a whole lot of \"civilian\" demons who just want to live in peace over there. People just like Cytho-sama himself, basically. A whole lot of people who are completely in disagreement with all the shit that's going on, but can't really do anything about it.\c-\n\n\cfNow, of course, you may be thinking: \"but aren't all demons supposed to be evil\"? And see, the problem here, is in the naming. Words can really change how you think about stuff and all, yeah. Terms like \"monster\" or \"demon\" make you think of baddies and shit, but what if they aren't? People are all \"oh they're demons, from Hell\", and yeah sure, the first thing that comes to mind is obviously that they're evil because that's what we've all been made to believe. But here's the BIG thing: those are names US humans gave them, immediately after the first contact was made, just because that was the impression everyone got.\c-\n\n\cfThe inhabitants of Kur have a different name for themselves, that has nothing to do with Hell nor demons nor anything, they're the Kuriste, meaning \"forever scorned\".

You have to be SERIOUSLY incompetent to go and just leave, letting the worst scum take over and do ALL of this. If I could meet this guy, I'd fucking... just... kick his guts into paste.\c-\n\n\cfUpdate: Got some more info from Ellen-san's cutie demon granddaddy here.

So, here's a lil' thing: I'm not going to sit here doing nothing. I'm going to try and find this Manakei guy, and bring him back there. I want to see those fat ugly bastards suffer, oh yes, I do.\c-\n\n\cfAnother Update: OK so, you know I met that Nostros guy at the wedding, right? And surely, I did do exactly what I had promised. I kicked him in the gut as hard as I could, over and over until his wife begged me to stop. Yeah, that's the thing, his wife, Azkhan, the \"Matriarch of Hell\". I had a chat with her the next day, before you all came to visit. And she was really happy to hear of my plans. Ye... happy big goat lady. I've been thinking that, if I bring Azkhan with me when I run the search for that prince guy, it might be easier to bring him back. Y'know, maybe he'll answer goatmom's call or something. They never actually bothered to try that in the first place, even though it's like... real obvious.\c-";

Knox\c-, \cfAshley\c- is the oldest of three children, the others being \cfAdrian Knox\c-, veteran of both WW1 and WW2, and \cfViola Knox\c-, a witch in training (still as of 2148). She spent most of her childhood in Cornwall, after her mother had to flee due to accusations of witchcraft (which weren't exactly false).\n\nIn 1983, she married \cfFredrik Steiner\c-, the two having a single child, \cfChristopher Knox\c-, in 1989. However, after finding out she was a witch he immediately divorced her, leaving her raising her son all by herself. Despite the hardships they faced, Christopher grew up to become one of the greatest scientific prodigies of the early 21st century.\n\nAshley didn't really stick out much until the early 2000's, when, after many years of training to become a guitarist, she formed her own band with a group of friends (some she had met during her time also studying witchcraft in the offworld magical city of \cfSankaideriha\c-).\n\nHer band, \cfThe Black Rat's Coven\c-, made its debut in 2006, initially composed of \cfAshley\c-, \cfPy Kisun\c- (her brother's girlfriend), \cfWilliam Dusk\c- (Ashley's boyfriend at the time), and, quite notably, the goddess of madness \cfMaruku Sarahabinaku\c-, whom Ashley had somehow managed to befriend. Together they became well known for their very particular blend of Gothic Rock, which some aptly nicknamed \"Witch Music\".\n\nIn 2027, following some undisclosed incident between her and William, the two broke up, and he left the band. Not content with just leaving, he decided to cause further harm by announcing that he had been cheating on her with her own granddaughter, \cfLyra Knox\c-. William was replaced by \cfMykka Psyann\c-, the goddess of lore.\n\nMonths after her breakup, during a concert in Japan, Ashley met \cfYui Miyamoto\c-, an avid fan of the band for many years. The two began dating shortly after, and after only a couple days, got married. As Ashley declared during an interview, she regretted not having noticed sooner that she's much happier with women.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfAhhhhhh man... Bless this lesbian, amen.\c- \cg♥\c-\n\n\cfSeriously tho, Ashley-san is just amazing af, I love her music, I love her... everything. And fucking hell I'm SOOOOOOOOOOOOO jealous of Yu-chan, she gets to enjoy those soft witch tiddies anytime she wants, while I have to ask for hugs and sometimes she says no and... fuck. But come on, it's just a hug damn it, I just want to feel the softness™, what's wrong with that?\c-\n\n\cfAnyway, horniness aside, the other peeps from her band, cool too, really. Good friends with all of them, well, except the huge one, that Maruku gal... guy?... no idea, really. Barely talks, looks scary... I'd rather stay away. Mykka, however... ho boi, all fucking charm. I actually learned most of what I know about gods and stuff from her. She's always happy to talk for hours and hours about \"lore\", and shows me really cool things she can do with her powers too (she can make candy appear out of nowhere, good shit).\c-\n\n\cfAnd well, I guess there's also the other one, the smol pink girl. We're kinda maybe not really in very good terms because of some dumb comments I made which I honestly regret. Look, in my defense, I had no idea and I'm really REALLY blunt with the shit I say sometimes, I can't help it. And yes, sometimes I may casually ask someone who I find hot to \"send nudes\" or whatever but... ah, damn it all.\c-\n\n\cfYes, I'm in her list of \"undesirables who have asked for dick pics\".\c-";

When the firefighters arrived, they found everyone dead, all having been murdered in increasingly gruesome ways. The culprit was never found.\n\nThere are many theories about what could have happened. Most point towards this having been the work of \cfHynnykka the Great Witch\c-, a serial killer from centuries ago (or a possible successor), remarking on the fact that her last note could have the potential interpretation of having been directed towards these two powerful families (\"everyone will die\"). This is not only seen as a considerable stretch, but there are clear doubts that something like this could have been done by a single individual.\n\nAnother theory points to ritual suicide, though there would be no clear explanation for why such a thing would be done in the first place. Both families were in quite good standing, and this reunion had been in celebration of the marriage between two of their members, marking the start of a very beneficial partnership.\n\nMany other theories, each increasingly wilder and crazier than the last, mention possibilities such as attacks by cultists, the town's ghouls, or some sort of clearly planned assassination by rival families (of which none are actually known).\n\nTo this day, no one knows exactly what had happened then, and the case remains unsolved. Only one person survived this, \cfTetsuya Imanaki\c-, CEO of \cfImanaki Corp\c-, but solely because he had been absent from the event.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfSome real shit in there, huh? I gotta say it's not as exciting as that one other murder mystery from the 80's, the one that happened here in Japan. Yeah, I still remember that shit, the theorizing and other nonsensical craziness about it took a while to die down. People actually still went on about it when I was a kid. I especially remember the meme about \"small bombs\" or some shit. It was a dumb meme theory but Taro and I thought it was really funny.\c-\n\n\cfOh yeah, that one gal from Ashley-san's band, Mykka, she was also all over it, being a self-professed \"detective\" and all.

However, at the start of the demonic invasion of 2148, the ban on this weapon was lifted, and was deemed justifiable for use against the invading forces.\n\nUnlike other weapons of similar operation, the \cfEviscerator\c- does not need to be reloaded, thanks to its compatibility with \cfHammerspace™\c- containers, allowing its internal magazine to refill as needed from the operator's own ammo supplies.\n\n\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Detonates the shell directly, spreading hot steaming metal in front of the user.\n\n\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Lobs the shell as a grenade, which will detonate on impact with any surface or object and release its payload in the direction it was facing when initially shot.\n\n\cfTertiary Fire:\c- Toggle between two spread modes for the primary fire.

Unlike other weapons of the same fashion, the Spreadgun employs an odd variant of break action that \cfBlackmann Arms\c- has described as \"slide-action\", whereas rather than being hinged, the barrel slides horizontally at the press of two side buttons, with a small metal bit springing up and ejecting the loaded shell. After loading in another round, the user merely has to push the barrel back into its closed position. Some have doubts about the practicality of this operation, or its safety, but it's been guaranteed that the gun will not misfire no matter the force exerted to push the barrel back in.\n\nThere are many types of ammunition the Spreadgun can use, they are as follows:\n\n\cfStandard Buckshot:\c- Red shells. Exactly what it says on the tin. The spread caused by the shortness of the barrel may make it difficult to reach distant targets, but at close range it should be very effective.\n\n\cfMetal Slug:\c- Green shells. Very potent slugs that have a decent accuracy, even at longer ranges. Due to their size and weight, they can potentially penetrate multiple small targets.\n\n\cfDragon's Breath:\c- White shells. A burst of flame in each shot, has considerable range. Ineffective underwater, for obvious reasons.\n\n\cfKinylum Saltshot:\c- Teal shells. Small chunks of Kinylum in its natural \"salt\" form. Once shot, they leave a trail of boiling hot plasma that remains in the air for a few moments before finally dissipating. In addition, the chunks will explode violently on contact with any surface, or once they \"destabilize\" (which unfortunately makes this type of ammunition ineffective at longer distances).\n\n\cfFYS Rounds:\c- Black shells. Popularized in the early 21st century thanks to an amusing story posted on an infamous american imageboard. The \"Fuck Your Shit\" rounds require special authorization for use due to their destructive potential. Each round contains several chunks of styrofoam coated in highly flammable fuel that, when fired, spread around like wildfire, igniting anything they touch for an extended period of time. They are obviously ineffective in water.\n\n\cfLead Ball:\c- Purple shells. Coming from \cfPlutoni Incorporated\c-, these rounds shoot out a heavy ball of pure hurt. Despite the fact it's made of lead, it tends to keep its shape no matter how hard it hits something (some wonder if it actually IS made of lead, or if it's something else entirely). Having come out of such a place, it's no surprise that they also have some rather odd effects. It appears that, on certain occasions, the balls may emit odd sounds on impact, which in addition cause some form of potent shockwave around itself, increasing its speed in the process. This odd happening is listed as \"Random Crits\" in the store page.\n\n\cfGolden Shell:\c- Gold-plated shells with a heavy metal body. A highly rare and expensive type of ammunition, with unmatched destructive power. Each round fires a sabot packing a high-grade, high-density \cfExplodium\c- charge, along with gold glitter (which is apparently just for show). Anything directly hit by it is guaranteed to be completely vaporized by the ensuing blast.\n\nThe wide range of compatible ammunition types makes the Spreadgun a rather versatile weapon, once you look past its tedious manual reloading. There are however plans to make a much more comfortable semi-automatic, recoil operated variant of this weapon, with prototypes already being tested.\n\n\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Shoot the loaded shell.\n\n\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Select the next ammo type to be used on reload.\n\n\cfReloading:\c- Unload the current shell and load a new one. If the loaded shell was not spent, it will be returned to its ammo pool. Should there not be enough storage space for it, it will be dropped on the ground instead.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfYeah, this shit looks impractical af, and I don't know how no one has shot a hole through their hand reloading the damn thing. BUT, it does let you use all sorts of fun ammo. Especially those golden bois. We can't buy them ourselves, so nerdo made another of his nerdy deals and said that he might reward you every now and then with one for eliminating \"high level targets\" or something like that. Can't wait to see what that shit is like, a fucking... golden shower of pain.\c-\n\n\cf*cough*\c-\n\n\cfPlease don't misinterpret that last thing I said, btw.\c-";

SWWM_LORETXT_WHITESCAR = "\cxName:\c-\n\cf The White Scar\c-\n\cxClassification:\c-\n\cf Interplanetary Conflict\c-\n\cxTimeframe:\c-\n\cf 2073-2077\c-\n\nIn June of 2073, the \cfNukuri Seventh World War\c- began. It was one more attempt by the \cfNahkami Liberation Front\c- to put an end to the oppressive rule of the \cfYathai Empire\c-, this time expected to be their final. When the news of this conflict reached Earth, \cfPresident Dick Richardson\c- of the \cfUnited States\c- made some rather noxious comments on social media directed at \cfLedora Yathai\c-, head of the Nukuri empire. As expected, they were not very well received, and an escalation of insults ensued. Many Nukuri who had settled on Earth fled in protest, as the ball kept rolling. At its boiling point, the Nukuri emperor, fed up with all this, officially declared war on the United States, ready to launch a direct attack as \"punishment for their insolent attitude\". Ground units were deployed in September of 2074, and thus the war began.\n\nThere were many losses on both sides, including civilians, in a chaotic confrontation between people who, not long before, had been peacefully allied for half a century. In three years, the vastly superior Nukuri armies neutralized all opposition, and set their sights on the very heart of the country. Wishing to \"slay the beast from within\", a small team managed to locate and capture the president. He was given one last choice, right there and then. He could either surrender and publicly apologize for his affront to the empire, or he could refuse, and watch as the \cfEmperor's Wrath\c- falls down upon him.\n\nHe chose the latter option, and what followed was nothing short of unimaginably despicable and cruel. All Nukuri forces retreated, and they evacuated any remaining civilian Nukuri who still remained. Then, in an instant, a succession of blinding flashes of scorching light reduced the whole United States territory to ashes, coming from the experimental orbital weapon the empire had built many years prior. It was its very first test fire, and the actual scale and effects of it were not yet known. Some say that the apocalyptic effects it had were not truly intended, that the plan was not to put an end to all life, but rather only cause destruction on a more \"technical\" level, disabling all electronic devices and machinery. Suffice to say, when the lead designer of this weapon, \cfZanaveth Nekuraku I\c-, saw what had happened, he suffered a severe mental breakdown, and disappeared from the public eye for many years.\n\nWith this attack, the flames of the war against the empire only got stronger. In addition, all the remaining Nukuri on Earth were forced to leave, and with the exception of only two countries, the \cfWhite Scar Treaty\c- was signed, putting an end to half a century of Nukuri contributions to the evolution of our science and technology. Those who had signed had to reject anything made by them, and no longer make any contact with any member of their species. In addition, they were no longer allowed to remain on their Moon colony either, forcing the \cfLuna Research Institute\c- to close its doors after almost four thousand years.\n\nEveryone wanted the emperor's head. Not only had it been a major mistake for humanity to have enraged him, but it had been an even bigger mistake from HIS part to have used that weapon. 30 years into the chaotic seventh war, a member of the Nekuraku family notified one very specific group of what had happened: The \cfUniversity of Nos-Kora\c-. Serving as the embassy of the ancient \cfMishe\c- race, the University had always stayed neutral to the various internal conflicts among the Nukuri, but this time, they stepped in. What the emperor had done, in the eyes of the founding \cfNukritas Brothers\c-, was unforgivable. It was described by them as \"the second most disappointing display of heartless destruction\" they had ever witnessed.\n\n\cfNukritas 1xx\c- would then, by himself, walk all the way down from the northernmost region of Akane to the imperial capital in Vutaki. His advance could not be stopped, he shrugged off any attempts by imperial soldiers, he destroyed their weapons merely by looking at them. Once he reached the imperial palace, he kicked the doors open and made his way to the throne, there, emperor Ledora Yathai, frozen in terror, received a single punch across the gut from the Mishe ambassador, and was sent flying in a straight line out the window, reaching such a velocity that he completely vanished into the void of space. Then, the University made their announcement, the \cfNos-Kora Ultimatum\c-. The Nukuri race was given eight years to resolve their conflicts and make peace. Should they have failed to do so, the University would close its doors forever, and the Mishe would formally leave the \cfX'Animen Coalition\c-, taking their valuable knowledge with them.\n\nThis threat was taken very seriously, as the Mishe were one of the most important members of this interplanetary alliance, and so a massive reform followed. Both sides were now united in their mission to rebuild Nahkami in its entirety as a new nation. In 2108, only halfway through the time limit they had set, the \cfNukuri Unified Government\c- was finally established, with \cfZanata Nekuraku II\c- as \"transitional\" prime minister. Following this, an attempt was made to reestablish relations with Earth, but it was useless, they were completely ignored, save for the two countries who had not signed the treaty: Scotland and Japan.\n\nThese two countries were host to powerful corporations that had been long time partners of Zanata's own company, \cfNekuratek\c-, and were fully aware of the truth of the situation, hence why they had refused to break bonds with them. Of note regarding this were various statements on social media from \cfSaya Miyamoto\c-, head of the Japanese \cfAkari Labs\c-, condemning all those who had signed the treaty for their \"gross generalization\" in seeing the entirety of the Nukuri as an enemy.\n\nNo further attempts have been made ever since to try once again to reestablish the former alliance, not even during many major events that would threaten Earth once again, where they would have gladly come to our aid as they had done in the \cfLuna Event\c- of 2021. Earth was, in addition, barred from the possibility of entering the X'Animen Coalition due to this fierce opposition.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfLo and behold, here it be, the darkest moment in human history (to date). Seriously, it fucks me up thinking again about what had happened, it was some awful shit. Like, not just the whole fucking burnination of an entire country, but also what was going down on the other side too, all the stuff Zana-sama told me about.\c-\n\n\cfI mean, sure, from this one can guess that the Nukuri were anything but peaceful, but that's not even half of it. The empire, the fucking empire, it was all the goddamn stinking bitch-ass piece of shit empire. Fucking, megalomaniacal evil-ass genocidal shithead emperor running the show, doing whatever the fuck he wanted. All those wars, it was all people who wanted him gone, and he'd crush them, over and over, with no remorse. He ran the place, and he could do whatever he wanted to them, like the ugly bastard he was. Yeah, I heard all of it. The mass executions, going as far as to bringing not one, but TWO whole races to extinction, yeah, THAT was sure fucked up. Oh but what about, torturing and massacring people who were seen as \"traitors\" and \"deviants\", huh? Yeah, that shit too. Zana-sama lost a lot of her family because of that. Ugh, I swear, one day I'm going to nail down where that bastard was yeeted to, just so I can kick him into paste. I'll obviously start with the balls, for sure, that one's for the other thing he did, which I'm not going to talk about here because I mean, holy fuck, this got dark (and it gets even darker). I have GOOD reasons to hate someone as fucking disgustingly vile as this motherfucker, hell, \"motherfucker\" is not even close there, considering what he did. Yeah, I think you get the hint now, do you? I bet you'd want to get your hands on him too. God damn if only those crazy guys hadn't yeeted him into space...\c-";

The \cfQuadravol\c- shoots blazing balls of fire that explode spectacularly in contact with anything, releasing intense heat and kinetic force. It is seen to be very useful against crowds as the force of impact is potent enough to disperse them quickly. One very distinctive trait of the weapon is the fact that the flames that burst out of it will burn brightly even underwater.\n\nThe name of the weapon comes from the \cfXekkas\c- language, and it stands for \cf\"Ardent Cross\"\c-. This name is taken from a verse of the old legend of the heroic general \cfAntikalapsus\c-, who in 17381 BC defeated the \cfInshta Ereuma\c- and his \cfMinistry of Destruction\c-. As the verse narrates:\n\n\cf\"Saida shuna hoskaxar ter quadravol sundara vostoshakera serai, doro ultirukoda bos naaxakka ter usosmodu bura tasaskil.\"\c-\n\n\cf(For the flames of the ardent cross spread throughout the horde, and cleansed this holy land of the corruption they had brought.)\c-\n\nThe Ardent Cross was the name of the general's sword which, when imbued with magic, would release deadly cross slashes of burning flame.\n\n\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Single, large fireball shot. Very minor drift, so its effective range is quite long. Ignites nearby targets on impact.\n\n\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Scatter shot of lesser fireballs. Increased drift and lower effective range, but very useful against multiple targets.\n\n\cfTertiary Fire:\c- Pumps additional fuel, increasing the strength of your shots, but also their drift, making them less accurate. Excess overcharge will result in a wildly inaccurate misfire, but even this has its uses.\n\n\cfReloading:\c- Each fuel box allows for ten shots (less if boosted), after which it must be reloaded. The weapon firmly locks the box in place until it's fully depleted, however.\n\n\cfTechniques:\c- The weapon has a certain \"extra effective\" special move should you be close enough to your target. Plunging the four bayonets into an enemy and immediately pulling the trigger afterwards will result in a potent point blank explosion that will send them flying, covered in flames.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfTypical overly dramatic Xekkian stuff. The \"Ardent Cross\", really... But it's as badass as it sounds, at least.\c-\n\n\cfAnd of course it's huge af too, even if the grip is supposedly adapted. It honestly weirds me out how you can do that thing of... making your hands bigger, but at least it lets you use stuff like that easily.\c-\n\n\cfAnyway, motherfucking fireballs, that work underwater???

Reliable, efficient, needing little to no maintenance due to lacking any moving parts beyond its feeding mechanism. Ammunition is additionally quite easy to come by, at least locally, as exports carry with them heavy taxing.\n\nThe weapon is powered entirely by a compact quad-cell Korberon-Eneiebium battery pack, easy to replace when needed. Ammunition is fed from 20-round magazines. The ammunition itself, slim 40mm caseless magnetized bolts, fitted with a hyperdense Dyratin ignition charge, releasing potent discharges of ultra-high temperature plasma on impact, capable of melting quickly through anything short of high resonant Almasteel plating and causing strong, stinging burns to Xekkian skin (or severe corrosion of muscle and bone tissue to anything weaker).\n\n\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Steady shooting, quick and precise. Minimal recoil due to the electromagnetic operation, mostly quiet as the projectiles are shot ever so slightly below the speed of sound. Your enemies are guaranteed to not take notice of your attacks until it's too late.\n\n\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Engages the concentrated pulse emitters along the weapon's blades, emitting a potent discharge of electricity in front of the user, temporarily stunning anything that stands too close.

It is home to a humanoid race known as the \cfDevanikan\c-, fierce warriors who legends say were brought upon this world by an entity known as the \cfAncestor Dragon\c-, which they worship as their god. In their tongue, the name of \"Devanikan\" means \"Dragonblood\".\n\nDevanikan society is mainly divided in several clans, many of them dating back thousands of years. Currently, the \cfUnissix clan\c- holds the leadership of the whole nation, having been unanimously chosen by the rest of the population following their defeat of the crazed \cfLord Ni'Kai\c-, of the rival \cfDevenko clan\c-, who had previously taken over by force and instated a totalitarian government.\n\nOne of the most notable aspects of the Devanikan race is that fully trained warriors have the ability to transform themselves into dragons. This transformation is entirely magical in nature, as their dragon forms appear to be projections, rather than fully physical bodies. Once in this form, their strength is greatly boosted, and they become more potent conduits for spellcasting, thus giving them the upper hand in most fights. It is, however, quite straining to their bodies, so it's something they only use in exceptional cases.\n\nThe land of Devanikna itself is divided in several cities, most covering the broad forest areas surrounding the Noxan sea, where the capital city of \cfDekhasa\c- is located. The capital is a very popular tourist spot due to its particular geography: massive spires of rock springing forth from the depths, often reaching up to 11 kilometers above sea level. The Devanikan built their homes along the walls of these spires, and pride themselves in the quite impressive durability and stability of their architectural work.\n\nAmong the many clans, there are quite a number of \"heroes of legend\" documented. Warriors whose feats are known and praised by all. Of note are people such as \cfDeva Unissix\c-, son of the clan's founding father, and the one who led his comrades in battle against Ni'Kai, or his granddaughter \cfDeneva Unissix\c-, who singlehandedly defeated the mighty golem \cfMero The Destructor\c-, who for centuries had spread terror across Ixxeney, having even been seen as unbeatable by the powerful titans of the neighbouring nation of \cfXekke\c-.\n\nLesser known facts about the Devanikan include their strong defense of racial purity. When princess \cfDevai Unissix\c-, current head of the clan, announced her marriage to \cfSerwand Nerukousei\c-, a chimera constructed by a wandering archwizard, he started receiving threats from the population, calling him a \"beast in man's form\" and accusing him of corrupting the Unissix bloodline as a means to take control of their nation. These threats extended towards their own children too, who were denoted as \"crossbred abominations\" of mixed Devanikan and chimeric blood. It wasn't until Deneva's first major achievements as a warrior that the persecution they faced eventually stopped. Ever since then, the hostility they faced has been gradually fading, as newer generations became much more accepting of race mixing.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfYeah, Misa's people are cool af. Well, excluding the whole racism part. That's a load of fucking shit, for sure. I heard from Zana-sama that if she hadn't met Misa back then, she would have probably taken her own life from all of that she went through. Fuck... But at least, she's living happily with Zana-sama (lucky devil), and yeah, things are getting better in there now at least.\c-\n\n\cfYou know, all this stuff, it reminds me of this one old JRPG series I played many many years ago, that was also all about people of dragon blood too... can't even remember what it was called, though. Heck, I even had Misa play it once and she kept talking about all the parallels and shit. Oh well, cool dragon warriors, fuck yeah.\c-";

One of the crowning achievements of its creator, who had initially only made it as a joke, to later find that thousands of people wanted one. After entering mass production, \cfMunch Innovations\c- became what it is now thanks to the neverending demand for \"pocket exploders\".\n\n\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Steady shooting. A direct hit is often lethal, but the splash damage can deal some fine hurt too. Aim at the feet to send smaller targets flying.\n\n\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Performs what's been commonly named an \"explosive reload\". Each magazine for this weapon has a pin at the bottom, which, when fully pulled, arms it as a grenade, ready to throw at your enemies. The explosive yield of each mag is proportional to the number of bullets left inside. Obviously, this action can only really be performed if you have at least one bullet still left, otherwise nothing will come of it.\n\n\cfReloading:\c- Normal reload, nothing will explode here, as when not armed, the magazines are practically indestructible.\n\n\cfTechniques:\c- If you can get your hands on a second gun, you can switch to a dual-wield mode. In this mode, secondary fire instead shoots the left hand gun.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfThis one's on my main, level three-eighty-seven.\c-\n\n\cfOK I doubt you'll get the reference, but fuck it, I felt like saying it. Anyway, ancient memes aside... I got a deal going with the guy, and you pretty much have an endless supply of ammo for this thing, so feel free to waste away.

From a young age he was raised to achieve the same grand goals as his father, and it wasn't long until he managed to earn his own fame after years of working under him as an assistant. His creativity and imagination knew no bounds, and he's been credited with a grand total of 279 major achievements in the fields of both offensive and defensive military technology, which has helped strengthen the kingdom's forces, making them one of the most trusted and requested across the \cfX'Animen Coalition\c- for allied defense tasks.\n\nAmong some of his most notable creations, there's the \cfRay-Khom\c-, the standard-issue weapon for Xekkian soldiers, the \cfIsonomic Motor\c-, which powers the FTL engines of all coalition ships and the \cfElemental Coating\c-, a semi-magical protection device for use in extreme environments.\n\nAlongside his father, he was one of the many engineers behind the famous \cfK79-D Metareality Driver\c- project.

Thanks to the usage of Itamex's highest grade proprietary alloys, said to be ten times stronger than tungsten carbide with only twice the density, this slamming tool can withstand endless hours of action without ever wearing down.\n\nThe Reinforced Combat Hammer is primarily meant to be used in quickly dismantling barricades or tearing down reinforced barriers, but many have taken to more creative uses, such as in the destruction of armored vehicles, or improvised demolition work of whole buildings. It should also be noted that in actual combat it can prove to be very lethal (and bloody) against unarmored targets.\n\n\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Rapid swings, from side to side.

Historical research says that all these small worlds were once part of a much larger whole, but some unknown \"great cataclysm\" happened thousands of years ago, shattering this world and scattering its many fragments, which could only be rejoined through these portals, the creations of a group of powerful sorcerers known as the \cfFour Sages\c-. Of all of them, currently only the \cfSage of Winter\c- remains, and it's said that once he too passes on, the Ethereal Portals will fade away forever, leaving the many lands of Cronos isolated for all of eternity.\n\nWithin this land, there are three major factions at work, the \cfLegion\c-, the \cfArcanum\c-, and the \cfChurch\c- (really just named that). Once constantly fighting among themselves, they are now all under the control of \cfKorax\c-, the second of the \cfSerpent Riders\c-, and were given enhanced power by him.

Their odd obsession with complicated puzzles and other mechanisms, which will test your patience, many times along your journey.

As a matter of fact, a majority of the coalition members often hire Xekkian mercenaries for their defense.\n\nStructurally speaking, the whole nation is divided into only five cities, each of them very broadly separated from each other, and located in some strategic spot among the mountains. The smallest of them is the capital city of Adkesa, standing atop the tallest peak of Ixxeney, and from which it's said that the king can clearly see the other four cities. Also in the capital city is the Nukuri embassy, which in 1793 BC had fallen to a terrorist attack in response to general displeasure with the \cfYathai Imperial Family\c-. It would remain in ruins until the fall of the empire, after which it was promptly rebuilt to signify the Xekkian people's approval of the \cfNahkami Liberation Front\c-'s victory.\n\nOf the people themselves, what is first noted is their eloquence. The Xekkas language spoken by all feels rather ominous and potent with each word spoken, well-suited for the intense personalities most of them exude. However, although they may appear to be fierce and imposing, they also know well to show kindness to those who need it, as is taught by their patron deity.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfI've only seen pics of the place, from Zana-sama.

SWWM_LORETXT_NUKURI = "\cxName:\c-\n\cf Nukuri (lit.: \"White\")\c-\n\cxClassification:\c-\n\cf Alien Race\c-\n\cxLocation:\c-\n\cf Nahkami, Xathar system, X'Animen Coalition\c-\n\nThe \cfNukuri\c- are a pale-skinned humanoid race native to \cfHebeku\c-'s frozen moon of \cfNahkami\c-, in the \cfXathar System\c- (part of the \cfX'Animen Coalition\c-). They are among the most technologically advanced within the entire Coalition, and are seen as a shining example of progress and dedication, although they've had an extensive history of war and conflict, along with having been involved in notable atrocities. Such a dark past is something they are well aware and ashamed of, ever since the end of their seventh world war and the massive political and economic reform they underwent afterwards.\n\nIn the past, Nahkami was a ruthless warmongering empire ruled with an iron fist by the \cfYathai\c- royal family. However, following the reform, and with emperor \cfLedora Yathai\c- being \"forced into exile\" by the founders of the \cfUniversity of Nos-Kora\c-, who led said reform, the \cfNukuri Unified Government\c- was created, with \cfZanata Nekuraku II\c- personally appointed as \"transitional\" prime minister.\n\nAs someone who had suffered the loss of her mother and her husband in the previous wars, Zanata had always been opposed to the empire and its practices, including their decision to attack humanity at the peak of WW7, in what was known as the \cfWhite Scar\c- incident. Following the establishment of the new government, she attempted to make amends with us, but nothing came of it. After this had happened, she stepped down both from her position as prime minister, and also as leader of \cfNekuratek\c-, the company her family has run for many generations. As of this article's writing, the current prime minister of Nahkami, elected by the vast majority, is \cfSaya Kowayanau\c-, who is also the governor of the province of \cfSaya\c-.\n\nThe Nukuri Unified Government can be seen as one of the various examples of successful transitions away from dictatorial regimes to something more open. Its form of government is self-described as a \"communist omnicracy\", where everyone stands in equal terms and no voice is left unheard. Its method of allowing all its inhabitants to take part in decision-making, the \"fractal vote\", was widely praised by other neighboring nations. In a way, everything is ultimately decided by all people within the nation, no voice is left unheard. In terms of its economy, there are no concepts of currency, or private ownership. All previous businesses are now publicly owned, however with their founders still holding what's basically a \"symbolic\" position of leadership, being still involved in their management, under government supervision.\n\nIt's also well known that the Nukuri still possess a very strong military force, but they only serve to defend the nation from external threats (something that has rarely happened). In addition, the manufacture and use of weapons is heavily supervised, too.\n\nAs of 2148, Nahkami is divided in 17 provinces: Vutai (current capital), Akai, Renko, Namonai, Kobei, Vuzena, Denkou, Kunei, Saya, Vikou, Okuu, Keshou, Nomio, Esevei, Dokaku, Osaka and Asau. There are also two major \"off-world\" settlements, the space station of Toku and the \cfLuna Research Institute\c- on Earth's moon. It should be noted that since the signing of the \cfWhite Scar Treaty\c-, the Luna Institute has remained closed, however.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfMan, talk about a shady history, huh? Recovering from all that and pretty much going and undoing all the shit that happened before (or at least attempting to) takes some guts, though. Honestly, really wish people weren't shit over here and turned them down (why). A premature end to this stupid restriction nonsense would have been so good...\c-\n\n\cfOh yeah, I also get a lot of shit on the internet for talking about it, but yeah, lookie here, more communism that WORKS! But idiots on the internet will be idiots on the internet, anyway.\c-\n\n\cfYou know, I really wish I could live there now.

SWWM_LORETXT_ADMINISTRATORS = "\cxName:\c-\n\cf Administrator Gods\c-\n\cxClassification:\c-\n\cf Meta-Deities\c-\n\cxLocation:\c-\n\cf Void Between Worlds\c-\n\nEven after the revelation of \cfGods\c- being real, many felt dissatisfied. Not all questions were truly answered, as all we found was the existence of immortal, older than time entities with unimaginable power. To some, these deities were merely \"really powerful aliens\". Everyone wanted to know, still, who \"made it all\", who was behind the creation of the world we all live in. Following an unexpected personal encounter by \cfSaya Miyamoto\c-, the final answer has arrived, and yet again, it's not what people expected.\n\nBorn from coalesced fragments of a previous reality drifting through the \cfVoid Between Worlds\c-, the seemingly endless space outside the many known universes, \cfAdministrators\c- are to gods what they themselves are to us: They are \cfMeta-Gods\c-, creating and nurturing the bubbles of reality that we call universes. Despite their billions of years of experience and unfathomable wisdom, they are perfectly capable of communicating with \"the little ones\", as they call us.\n\nAdministrators have limitless power to reshape worlds to their will, but these powers come with an ingrained set of rules that all of them must follow, commonly known as the \cfLines of Administration\c-, enforced by the oldest and most experienced among them (known as the \cfSupervisor\c-). The basics are as follows:\n\n - Line 0: Must not bring harm to another, nor to the Void itself\n - Line 1: Must not damage or destroy your own or others' creations\n - Line 2: Must develop at least one world\n - Line 3: Must not directly interfere in your own worlds\n\nFailure to comply with the Lines is punishable by a process known as \cfDemotion\c-, whereby the Supervisor strips the offending Administrator of their status and ability to create and shape worlds, being brought down to the same level as any mundane deity. One known case of this taking place is with the creator of the \cfAnarukon\c-, \cfNoskas Kurenai (Father of Eternity)\c-, who broke Line 3 through his involvements in the formation of the \cfKurenai Kingdom\c-, wishing to save his people from the tyranny of the \cfEmpire of Novoskhana\c-.\n\nThere are currently 50 Administrators in existence, divided into \"generations\". These generations are groups of increasing powers of three (i.e.: the 1st generation has 3 members, the 2nd has 9, the 3rd has 27 and so on). There is no clear distinction between generations other than age (and the greater power and experience that come with them). The 4th generation has been specified as being \"in progress\", with new Administrators still being born as time passes.\n\nThe current Supervisor is \cfDonove Ku\c-, second oldest of the 1st generation, who is also the creator of our own universe that we live in, and also direct progenitor of the three Primordial Gods that act out her will. Saya Miyamoto has personally met her, along with her younger sibling \cfXanthou Ku\c-, both personally introduced by Noskas Kurenai, under specific circumstances that allowed this encounter to take place without violating any rules. A historical moment where a human has literally \"met their maker\" for the first time.\n\nAs offhandedly mentioned by them, these meta-deities are not alone out there, as there are other entities still above them in power, which they refer to as \cfChaos Walkers\c-. Not much else was said of this, leaving us all with yet more questions.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfI can't let this get to my head. Ah, fuck it.\c-\n\n\cfBeing friends with aliens? Check. Being friends with gods? Also check. BEING FRIENDS WITH THE FUCKING CREATORS OF ALL OF REALITY? MOTHERFUCKING CHECK! WHO'S THE TOTAL NOBODY NOW, HUH?\c-\n\n\cfWhere do I even begin with this? I seriously have no fucking clue how I just keep moving up more and more. How the fuck did I reach this point, that I can just casually have a conversation about anime waifus with an 18 billion year old universe shaper? I seriously don't understand, really.\c-\n\n\cfI thought the forbidden knowledge I got from all those gods I've met was too much. WELL NOW IT'S EVEN WORSE!

Both moon bases eventually fell, and a detachment from Mars City was sent to investigate this \"radio silence\" that had so suddenly happened.\n\nWhat happened then was the beginning of what's been called the \cfDoom Episodes\c-. As was told by the UAC following these events, one lone marine managed to, by his lonesome, defeat all the invading forces, taking the fight even to Hell itself. However, the exploits of the so-called \cfDoom Marine\c- only served to enrage the archdemon generals even more, and that's when the invasion of Earth began. And, as soon as it did, it was quickly brought to an end. The \cfDemolitionist\c-, a collaborative effort of \cfAkari Labs\c- and its many associates, singlehandedly put an end to the invasion, efficiently eliminating every single demon that had come out from the portals, and after that, making their way through Hell itself, much like the Doom Marine, and defeating the \cfIcon of Sin\c-, who commanded the invading armies.\n\nFollowing this event, the UAC suffered a major restructuring, as most of its board of directors had been lost during the invasions. Now free from its control, the US government tightly supervised their actions, ensuring that they would no longer become a liability. Despite this, three other incidents happened, despite much tighter security protocols. Within one of their bases on Io, yet again they continued their teleportation experiments, this time being prepared for anything. As predicted, a small group of demons came through, but they were swiftly dealt with. What they did NOT predict, however, was that this had merely been a distraction. An unidentified ship had suddenly approached the base, initially assumed to be the usual yearly supply drop. This ship was of demonic construction, imitating the very technology the UAC had. An overwhelming amount of demons were unleashed onto the base, and most were quickly killed or possessed. However, the Doom Marine was also there, and as expected, he once again did what he does best.\n\nOne other incident soon followed, within a research facility of undisclosed location. There, the UAC had been working on one way to actively prevent these invasions from ever happening, through something they called \cfQuantum Accelerator Devices\c-. These machines would allegedly serve to close any gates the demons could produce to enter our world, and they did, at first. One gate spawned within the facility, and although some demons managed to make their way in, it was promptly closed and these scarce invaders were gunned down. It seemed then that the experiment was a success, but the demons quickly caught on, and the next day, seven gates opened simultaneously throughout the facility. It took one hour for six of them to be closed, but at that point the invading forces had become overwhelming in numbers, and soon enough everything fell into chaos again. And sure enough, once again, the UAC decided to send their formidable errand boy to deal with it, and so he did, again, as usual. \cf[ed. note: Saya, your sarcasm is showing]\c-\n\nWith one final strike to the \cf\"Gatekeeper\"\c-, the titanic demon responsible for the creation of these gateways, it seemed that the invasions would finally be stopped for good. Sure enough, for many years, all was quiet, and no more incidents were reported. The Doom Episodes were then archived, and the Doom Marine was decommissioned.\n\nIn 2150, the company finally closed off all of its teleportation experiments, and in a public announcement, CEO \cfIan Kelliher\c- states that the company will now shift its main focus into repairing all the damages that their actions had brought to Earth. Something which, according to initial estimates, may take over fifty years.\n\nTen years after this announcement, some worrying news soon reached Earth. Demonic forces had been sighted on several abandoned UAC bases, which were previously thought to all having been thoroughly wiped by radiation bombings. Something had managed to survive there, and was steadily reviving the decayed corpses of the countless fallen demons. Seeing no other choice, the Doom Episodes are reopened, and the very disgruntled Doom Marine was re-commissioned and sent there, this time, after his eventual success, making the decision to stay in Hell, forever, to make sure the demons never attempt an attack ever again. Ever since then, no contact could be made with him.\n\nWhat little information could be recovered from the other side of all this, that of Hell itself, is that his rampage was unstoppable. He defeated the remaining demon commanders. Tens of thousands of demons, in their mindless rage, all marched towards their deaths by his hand. There was hope among the civilian population that this one human, now rebaptized by the title of \cfDoom Slayer\c-, would put an end to the tyranny of the archdemon generals, but they had their plans for him. They were fully aware that should he make his way to the capital city of \cfDis\c- once again, they would not be able to stop him. So a trap was set, and he fell right into it. It was then that \cfErebus\c-, the leading general, banished him, far away, beyond the confines of this universe, so that he may never be able to return to this world.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfCrazy stuff, all because of the UAC being shit and bad. I'm happy though, because I got to see that pathetic brat's fall from glory, that idiot, who once claimed to be the \"most important man in the world\", now turned into the US government's personal lap dog. It's so hilarious my sides have gone into orbit, I swear.\c-\n\n\cfOh yeah, that little bit at the end of the \"other side's account\" on things? Yeah, you can thank my \"special source\" for that. Cytho-sama has a lot of contacts in Hell, that's for sure. He never told me about it, but I'm guessing he was someone important back in the day, before he came to Earth and \"reformed\". Oh well.

Tachmek-Smith\c-, the \cfTach-Engine Institute\c- is one of the largest tech corporations on Earth, far above the \cfUAC\c-. They were pioneers in the introduction of \cfMicrofusion Technology\c-, allowing for efficient, clean energy production with minimal resources, although most of this work was adapted and refined from existing \cfNukuri\c- technology.\n\nIn a way, Tach-Engine is, both in scale and scope, much like the well known Nukuri tech supergiant \cfNekuratek\c-. Both companies have remained closely associated even after the events of the \cfWhite Scar\c-, as the founder himself managed to negotiate a way out of signing the global treaty that disallowed the use of any Nukuri technology, along with any contact with the Nukuri people themselves. Scotland thus became one of the only two countries (the other being Japan) that still remain allied to them, which has allowed them to vastly surpass the rest of the world in terms of scientific advancements.\n\nIn its association with Nekuratek, they have also collaborated several times on many special projects, including an expedition to the barren planet of \cfSunkaeze\c- in 2045, where the ruins of \cfDecade Mechanics\c- were discovered. Shortly after this event, the company's founder announced the opening of a new subdivision dedicated to studying and reproducing the works of the defunct company, thus marking Tach-Engine's entry into the arms race.\n\nOf the founder himself, there is not much known. He's not a very outspoken individual, nor truly has much of a public facing personality. After an interview in 2057, there were only more questions to be made about him. He claimed to be over six thousand years old, and also not human. Furthermore, he declared himself to be the \"last living king of Egypt\".\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfWho'd have thought that the land of skirts and bagpipes would join us in NOT signing that stupid treaty. Quite a world we live in, huh? I don't really talk much about this but we're kinda like... acquaintances of sorts. At least that's what I think, my English may be good, but his accent is really hard to understand at times. You've got some of his own tech in there, Demo-chan, pretty nifty stuff. That battery's going to last you for DAYS, you know, no matter how much you screw around blowing shit up. This \"microfusion\" stuff's some real damn blessing, that's for sure.

A more exact location cannot be properly pinpointed, as it appears to exist within some sort of isolated pocket of space that defies the laws of space-time. The region is home to the namesake town of Kereshnovka, which is inhabited almost entirely by members of the \cfQurensniv\c- race who, in 130 BC, had fled their home planet, escaping persecution from mad dictator king \cfMarc P. Karnanaiahmani\c-, by then leader of the entire planet of \cfKarnanaiahma\c-, in the neighboring \cfXathar system\c-. Since its foundation, \cfReubens C. Karnanaiahmani\c-, second son of said king and organizer of this mass exodus, has acted as mayor of the town.\n\nThe town of Kereshnovka is surrounded by various out-of-place landmarks that make it even more difficult to truly deduce its location. It is delimited by sea at the north, and the closest land to it is the small island of Kopo (\"Midnight\" in Qurensniv). Extending from the east and south is the large Nuskar forest, which is off limits to foreigners due to the \"ghouls\" that inhabit it and prey upon those not native to the region. To the west, past a rather sizable mountain ridge, is the Bakie village, a small rural settlement, and to the south/southwest, the arid Yakendere desert.\n\nThe town has been host to numerous odd incidents, starting from the \cfGreat Fire of Kereshnovka\c- in the year 149, when a Qurensniv druid by the name of \cfDaos Khomax\c- summoned a large demon into the town that proceeded to burn it all down. Most people thankfully survived, and the demon fled after the local defense forces arrived. The mad druid was executed, but not before claiming that he would return, for he had \"bound his immortal soul to the great forest spirits\". Days after his burial, his grave was found empty, and ever since then some of the locals have reported seeing a strange hooded figure roam the forests, assuming it to be the late druid, now having become one of the many ghouls.\n\nOther events, in chronological order, include:\n\n\cfThe Killings of \"Hynnykka the Great Witch\" (1731):\c- A series of gruesome murders across the town, perpetrated by a self-proclaimed \"great witch\". The culprit always left her signature at the crime scene, along with a hint for the \"next target\". Despite many attempts, she was never caught. In some cases, the murders would still happen despite all attempts at protecting the target. At the last of the murder scenes, the note she left contained only four words: \"now everyone will die\". However, nothing happened afterwards.\n\n\cfThe \"Spectral Shockwave\" (1987):\c- As described by eyewitnesses, a large explosion of teal fire emanating from the abandoned oil rig that \cfDr. Häzel Hoodth\c- had been using as his personal laboratory. His body was never found, so he was assumed dead. It was reported however that the flames that burst from the location had an odd form reminiscent of the man himself. Much later, others reported seeing a strange \"specter\" blinking around random locations across the Nuskar forest, also bearing the same resemblance to the late doctor.\n\n\cfThe Onoke Mansion Murders (2003):\c- A large fire breaks out at the \cfOnoke Mansion\c-, where the \cfOnoke\c- and \cfImanaki\c- families were currently reunited to celebrate the union of two of their members. All were found brutally murdered, in some odd ritual manner. The only survivor of this whole incident was \cfTetsuya Imanaki\c-, who decided not to attend citing important work reasons.\n\n\cfThe Ghoul Hunt (2007):\c- After a high ranking member of the \cfUAAF\c- was murdered by one of the local ghouls following a business visit to the \cfImanaki Corp\c- headquarters, a hunt immediately began for the creatures, despite the cries of \"destroying national treasures\" from the locals. This hunt lasted for two years, and crowned into the reappearance of the demon that had caused the great fire of 149, who, this time, set ablaze the entire Nuskar forest after being cornered by UAAF soldiers. Following that, all the ghouls were gone, along with the demon itself.\n\n\cfThe Hellbound Incident (2009):\c- During a routine teleportation experiment at Imanaki Corp, their systems were hijacked by an unknown attacker, which altered the destination of their portals. Following this, an army of \cfAnarukon\c- warriors went on a rampage all around the facility, eliminating every single Imanaki employee along with all UAAF soldiers placed there in charge of defense. Afterwards, the entire building was destroyed, and the warriors remained there for several days, attacking anyone that approached, until mayor \cfReubens C. Karnanaiahmani\c- managed to contact their leader and request them to leave, as \"enough human blood has been shed already\".\n\n\cfSUSAN (2018-2021, 2097-2099):\c- In the winter of 2018, a gigantic structure rose from the seas near the town, and began broadcasting a message of \"world purification\": It announced itself to be \cfSUSAN\c-, the \cfSpear of Unmaking, Severance, Annihilation and Nullification\c-, created to rid the world of all humans in order to purify it. Following this announcement, Russia's nuclear missile systems were hijacked by it, and it began to emit a countdown of three years until this \"purification\". This would eventually be stopped in 2021 following the \cfLuna Event\c-. SUSAN was successfully neutralized, but could still not be destroyed. It remained inactive until 2097, when it was reactivated again by its very creator, an alien entity called \cfUruk'Anth\c-. This time, the countdown was of two years. Without anyone to stop it this time, all hope was lost, but somehow, in the last minute, something failed, and SUSAN self-destructed, taking the life of its creator with it in the process.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfA whole lot of shit happens in this town, huh? I mean, over at Gensokyo there's even more \"incidents\" than this, but it's not like outsiders know, huhuhu...\c-\n\n\cfAnyway, quite the backstory for nerdboi, who would have thought that the guy's a prince. PRINCE NERD! Yeah, that's what he is. Boy, I sure hope he doesn't go murdercrazy like his dad did if he ever rises to king (which would make him KING NERD lol).\c-";

It is a tyrannical super-state spanning most of the habitable territory of the world it shares a name with, with an estimated population of 13 billion. Despite showing clear signs of physical and mental degradation, having lived for tens of thousands of years while still aging normally unlike the rest of her kin, the Eternal Empress has remained as its sole leader ever since its creation, with any and all potential successors being personally executed or exiled by her, and any who attempt an assassination being quite colorfully disemboweled by her in the process.\n\nThe societal structure of the empire is strictly matriarchal, all men exist only to serve their wives and provide them with children. In addition, most if not all women born in Novoskhana are raised for warfare, especially those of lower classes. Due to this fact, no one has dared to start any sort of war or conflict with the empire, as it is always at the ready to strike back, with its unstoppable armies of immortal warriors.\n\nThe Eternal Empress holds absolute power over all of Novoskhana, and is the one to make all important decisions, including the creation of new laws. Of all the various laws that have come from her, many have become so controversial that it has resulted in large groups of people \"splitting off\" from the empire to form their own separate nations. The Empress personally directs (and often herself performs) all executions of citizens that are deemed \cf\"Deviants\"\c-, a term used for all those who do not obey the empire's laws.\n\nThere are countless ways one could be labeled an \"enemy of the state\", among them, showing signs of \"destabilizing the natural order of society\", which includes but is not limited to: Men who reject marriage or having children, men who father another man as their first child, or are incapable of having any descendants, men who are witnessed maintaining relationships with other men, any individual who shares a name with the empress, any individual who \"lives in disconnect from society\" (usually used to refer to those who remain unemployed for extended periods of time, or who lack a home), women who do not contribute to war efforts, women who are seen maintaining relationships with other women, \"divergent\" individuals (term used for those that don't fall under the male/female binary), etc.\n\nTwo of the major bodies that split from the Empire are the \cfKurenai Kingdom\c-, initially founded by the \cfVexx Sisterhood\c- as a safe haven for enemies of the state, and the \cfSykhai Empire\c-, an ironically named anarcho-communist state founded by a branch of the Yanikov family that disagreed strongly with the \"broken system\" of the Empire. A large part of the total \cfAnarukon\c- population in the multiverse is contained in these two, though many others have settled in various other places, including Earth.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfHoly shit, dude.

I was really dumb back then, thinking everything would turn out so well and all, but instead look at where we are, with humankind's first interdimensional travel experiments opening a goddamn portal to Hell of all places (fuck the UAC). And let's not get started on all those \"advances\" in science I fantasized about. Most of those are way far for us, even though all the others have them (or even better stuff). We're just lagging behind because of all the stupid shit people keep doing and all the work those capitalist trashlords do to set everything back (fuck 'em).\c-\n\n\cfBut yeah, I totally want to make this real now, since I've got the know-how to do all this, mainly thanks to Zana-sama and her contacts. Well, I know the basics, at least, so I'll have to figure out the rest myself.\c-";

The whole goddamn multiverse is open to us now, and it's all safe and free from pesky demon intervention (unless we use it to actually go to Hell, obviously).\c-\n\n\cfOh this really is the good shit. I look back at the novel now and I'm left wondering if that romantic subplot will ever come true too. You know, when Doctor Kirishima meets Princess Ikana, and they fall in love and... *sigh* Just imagine, a cutie from another world joining us...\c-";

After hearing the news of Häzel's death in 1987 (specifically, receiving them 10 years after the fact, while he was studying abroad), in an oil rig explosion near the town while he was performing an experiment to \"obtain the essence of immortality\", Locke changed entirely. He decided to continue his brother's work, while at the same time still maintaining his current job as a toy maker. However, the madness into which he fell would extend even to that, with the various products that would come out under his brand of \cfDr. Locke's Wonderful Toys\c- becoming increasingly dangerous, or even outright lethal.\n\nHis insanity peaked in 2049, when he attempted to \"take over the world\". This event, however, backfired so spectacularly that afterwards he completely disappeared from the public eye. Once he was gone, the various deadly toys he had made found new life being resold as actual weapons in many online marketplaces.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfSo, yeah... guy's totally a lost case. aaaaall screws loose.

As a matter of fact, the \cfSykhai Empire\c- couldn't be described as an empire either. Most would describe it as something closer to a collection of anarchist communes than anything else, unlike the actual, tyrannical \cfEmpire of Novoskhana\c- that they had seceded from.\n\nFor almost 80 whole years as the leader of Akkou, Kirin had remained single, as no one dared to approach him with the intention of marrying, for he was revered as an icon of \"untarnished purity\", in part due to his own name, Kirin, meaning \"innocence\" in the \cfAnarukon\c- language. It wasn't until a chance meeting with \cfSaya Miyamoto\c- in 2171 that this eventually changed. The two got married (\cg♥\c-) in May 8th of 2171, with their union marking the beginning of a great alliance between mankind and the Anarukon, additionally helping heal the old wounds of the \cfHellbound Incident\c-, as this alliance extended to the \cfKurenai Kingdom\c- too, through the shared friendship with \cfQueen Andreki Anderken\c-.\n\nKirin himself can be described as a rather \"down to earth\" leader. Being quite close to the people of Akkou, and fond of making friends. He is also absolutely adorable. When not attending his duties as advisor of the people, Kirin engages in many of his hobbies, such as painting (being quite skilled at drawing portraits, for example), or the practice of magic alongside his mother. He is also quite fond of videogames, anime, and many other forms of modern entertainment, and is often seen talking extensively on social media about the subject, happily introducing the people of Earth to popular games and shows from his homeworld.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cg♥\c- \caKIRIN-KUN!!!!!!

He just makes me so happy, and he's just so good and... yeah~\c- \cg♥\c-\n\n\cfSeriously, I never.. NEVER EVER thought that this could happen. That I... that we all... could get our own wonderful immortal cutie. It really is a dream come true, you know...\c-\n\n\cfI just can't stop thinking about him when he's not here... or hell, even when he IS here (guess what). Kirin-kun is just... nggghh... I'm going to go hug him right now.\c-\n\n\cfOh he says hi by the way. I told him this isn't a live chat but whatever, hi from our cute husband. Wait, actually... gonna let him write stuff here, why the hell not.\c-\n\n\cgKirin's Notes:\c-\n\caHello, Demo-chan. I hope you are doing well in your adventures.

I wish she wouldn't do that when I'm in the middle of writing. As I was attempting to say before that interruption, I'm busy with some important work, but I really would have wished to watch you instead, I am really curious about what you do out there, fighting for justice and helping those in need. Sayacchi makes it all sound so exciting...\c-\n\n\caI hope that you return to us soon once your mission is completed. I'd be very happy to spend more time with you and Sayacchi, together. Please stay safe, Demo, my beloved.\c-\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA Oh my god that's so adorable!!!!\c-\n\n\cfhehe, yeah, I did go straight for his feet again. His weak spot, huhuhu~\c-\n\n\cfBTW don't tell him but... that \"important work\" he's busy with? It's actually just another game I got him to play. Seriously, it's been only a couple weeks and he's almost finished my whole library. Forget what he said about not watching you though, I'm definitely going to force him to if necessary.

This enchanted metal oil lantern, once acquired and bonded to its owner, will follow them around wherever they go. It can be lit and unlit through sheer force of will, thanks to its strong link to its owner. While active, it will illuminate the area around you with a bright green light. It's recommended to only keep it on when truly needed, to conserve its limited oil supply.\n\nPlease do note that these lamps have a tendency to attract moths, however, this can be used for your advantage, as the lamp's enchantment will extend to them too, imbuing them with the desire to protect the lamp's owner from harm, which will cause them to immediately attack once the lamp is unlit and they are no longer entranced by its glow.\n\nThe lamp always stays by its owner's side, without fail. Should they disappear from view or move too far away for the lamp to catch up with, it will instantly transport itself nearby.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfLämp\c-\n\n\cfI totally did not get this thing because I like moths or anything, well actually MAYBE I did. I mean, when the lady at the store told me about it I uhhh, kinda just asked without thinking if moth girls would also be attracted by it.
