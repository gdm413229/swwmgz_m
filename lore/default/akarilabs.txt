**Akari Labs**, known popularly as **The Fountain of Innovation**, is a R&D company from Kasukabe, Japan, mainly known for their work in the field of robotics. It is one of the largest companies in the country, overshadowed only by other tech giants such as **Mixom**.

The company was founded in 2010 by **Saya Miyamoto** and **Taro Miyamoto**, beginning its days as a small workshop in their garage. Over time, the rise in popularity of their ingenious inventions led to further expansion, and more people coming in to join them. As of 2148, there are around 170 employees, some coming from quite far away, too. Although the main headquarters are large enough to house most of them, some do work remotely, due to varying circumstances.

Among its many creations, the **Maidbots**, first introduced in 2017, are the most well known. Life-like humanoid assistant robots that can be freely adopted by any household. Each and every unit has their own unique personality and preferences, and despite their robotic appearance, are very much no different from a real person, having the same rights and being subject to the same laws as one. All Maidbots are trained from birth on all sorts of tasks, from common housework to first aid or even self-defense techniques. Although most are adopted to assist with housework and not much else, there have been many cases of customers dating or even marrying them. The labs' official stance on this is that there is "nothing wrong" with such a thing, but one must not forget that despite the fact Maidbots are "fully equipped for intimate acts", they cannot bear children.

During the **2020 Tokyo Olympics**, Saya's own personal Maidbot was appointed to sing the national anthem. Her voice captivated millions, and kickstarted her career as an idol.

In 2074, during the beginnings of **World War 3**, the labs faced some controversy after Saya Miyamoto personally accepted a 40 billion dollar contract from the US military, requesting her services for a classified supersoldier program. She had previously shown interest in delving into bioengineering, and even hinted at the possibility of Akari Labs entering the augmentation market, but once she was approached by them, there was only radio silence for three years. Afterwards, **Ibuki**, the **Red Oni**, was publicly revealed. Saya's creation proved to be quite effective in combat, despite her odd physical characteristics (most likely arising from her own personal tastes), but despite her success in pushing back the invading forces, there was nothing she could do to prevent the **White Scar**. Following her retrieval from the scorched wastelands several years later, Ibuki redid her life, ultimately becoming a world-famous supermodel due to her rather attractive physique.

Following the end of the war, Akari Labs did begin delving into biomechanical enhancements, which helped keep them afloat after the loss of all of their US-based financial backers, at least until the final reformation of the country as the **Union States** in 2137.

When the incident on the UAC's installations on Mars and its moons was made public, Saya immediately stepped up not just to personally insult CEO **Ian Kelliher** for his company's failures once again, but to also announce that should the invasion they brought upon themselves reach Earth, she would personally "build the ultimate fighting robot to kick their asses". As predicted, demon armies from Hell began coming from portals opening near UAC-owned installations all around the world, and then, as promised, Saya deployed her ultimate weapon, the **Demolitionist**.

As predicted, demon armies from Hell began coming from portals opening near UAC-owned installations all around the world, and then, as promised, Saya deployed her ultimate weapon, the **Demolitionist**.

The Demolitionist proved quite effective in combatting the demons, much more than the UAC's own forces were, or their so-called "problem solver", the **Doom Marine**. The Demolitionist was awarded for their impressive act of heroism, having not just completely suppressed the invasion and personally defeated the leader of the demon armies, but also assisted with the evacuation of thousands of survivors

The success of the Demolitionist project also further boosted the position of Akari Labs, who, in a mockery of the UAC, announced the involvement in their own personal "Demon Free" teleportation technology, known by the codename of **Akari Project**, named after the sci-fi novel about interdimensional travel that Saya had written in the early 2020's.
