The **Devastation Sigil** is a relic constructed and blessed by the god of hate themself. Those who call upon its blessing are charged with unmatched destructive power, allowing not just their own body but any weaponry they use to achieve absolutely devastating strength.

This blessing only works for a limited time, but nevertheless it's quite popular among warriors, although considered "unfair" to employ in some situations. Due to its nature, this artifact has no effect on deities, only mundane beings.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-

\cfI think I could totally beat you in a fight if I used this. I mean, not that I'd want to hurt you but... Just hypothetically speaking, you know.\c-
