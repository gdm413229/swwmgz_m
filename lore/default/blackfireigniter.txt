Devised by the primordial god of magic themself, the **Blackfire Igniter** is rather surprisingly a very cold, dark weapon. Blackfire is a type of magical flame that absorbs heat and light, rather than emitting them.

During the height of **Unissix Crafts**'s fame, the god personally approached **Misa Unissix** herself with a request for a weapon that would allow just about anyone to readily perform **Blackfire Manipulation Magic**.

The Igniter is the perfect blend of magic and technology, weaponized. At your fingertips, you have the power to call forth freezing flames that will turn your enemies into pretty ice statues in mere seconds.

\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Releases a continuous stream of Blackfire, with moderate range. The flames not only rapidly freeze whatever they touch, but also reduce the air temperature, leaving a lingering freeze effect.

\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Concentrated bursts that form spears of supercooled air which can impale small targets, or tear right through them.

\cfReloading:\c- Attach up to two canisters to replenish the weapon's internal dark mana reserves. Each canister will remain locked in until it's been emptied, otherwise residual energy could escape and bring harm to the user. If there is an empty canister attached, the reload action will detach it first. Fresh canisters can still be used even if the tank is full, and they will act as an extra "buffer" of mana until depleted.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfSo yeah, Misa-Misa has other toys besides that one bigass gun. Pretty cool that she gets requests and whatnot, lil' cinnamon roll's quite popular there, heheheh...\c-

\cfI heard very little of all this Blackfire stuff from LS-sama, but it sounds like fun. Wonder if it can be used in a spellcard...\c-
