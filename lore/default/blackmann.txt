**Blackmann Arms** was founded in 1924 by **Daniel Ischer**, initially under the name of **Schwarzmann Exotischwaffen**, as an "exotic weapons" workshop in Cologne, Germany. When the family migrated to America in 1933, in the beginnings of the **Nazi Regime**, the shop "americanized" itself under its current name, and quickly rose to fame designing all sorts of ingenious weaponry for the allied forces, and taking all sorts of requests for original designs, their slogan becoming "if you can imagine it, we can make it".

Blackmann became quite popular due to not only the swiftness in designing all kinds of odd firearms clients would request, but also some of their own original inventions, such as the **Silver Bullet** series of ultra-high caliber sniper rifles, or the **Puntzer** series of firearms designed to "penetrate any material, no matter how resilient", thanks to their patented **Spin Motion Wedge (SMW)** bullet design.

As of 2148, the company is handled by **Hermann E. Ischer** the great-great-grandson of its founder, who has made it his personal goal that any newly created weapon to come out of their factories capable of holding more than one bullet should have the ability to shoot out everything at once, or as quickly as possible. The man himself is also quite popular on social media due to his status as the world record holder for "largest eyebrows", often showing them off or talking in detail about the maintenance of such a thing.

A big part of the company's funding comes from **Mr. BIG SHOT**, who, according to reports by Hermann himself, regularly commissions all sorts of ludicrous shotgun designs that no sane man would ever think of using. Out of all these strictly private designs, one sole weapon was eventually made public, the **Wallbuster**, a 25-barrel revolving shotgun, chambered in 6-gauge, and said to be capable of "cleanly breaching through a barrier of pure lead half a meter thick".

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfYeah, yeah. Cool guns, and stuff. Some even got the blessing of Gun Jesus himself, too (god how I fucking miss him). But, yeah... I did realize one thing when digging up stuff to write this entry. It's about the name itself of this whole company. I'm pretty sure it's a reference to something, yeah... something big... and black... you get it now? Yes, that's it. Of course it's a fucking joke about BBC, OF... FUCKING... COURSE. The fucking guy really wanted everyone to think about his DICK whenever they looked at the massive guns he made??? DUDE, GROSS!!!\c-
