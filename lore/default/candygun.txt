A highly boosted variant of the standard **Explodium Gun**. Its magenta tint comes from its various parts having been "enriched" with a mixture of **Explodium**, strawberry flavored hard caramel and pop rocks, including the ammunition itself. Somehow, this odd combination has resulted in the weapon's typical explosive yield to become a deadly fireworks show with each shot. Not only that, but the fact that the weapon itself also contains Explodium makes it, on its own, quite dangerous for the user, should they accidentally hit it against something, therefore the gun is quite unpopular among the public, making its price skyrocket.

\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Single shots of explosive sweetness. A direct hit should be lethal on most targets, but if they somehow don't drop dead from that, the additional crackles and pops might do the deed, or spread the damage to nearby targets, too.

\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Perform an "explosive reload", just like with a standard Explodium Gun. Note that unlike its weaker counterpart, the yield is much more extreme. It is best practice to always have one spare magazine at the ready for the reload, so you aren't left with an unusable weapon should your throw miss the target.

\cfCombo Fire:\c- By holding secondary and primary fire (in that order) you can opt to, instead of performing the usual explosive reload, leave the magazine in the gun, armed and ready, then throw the whole weapon as a grenade, for the ultimate destruction. As always, make sure you at least have a spare and more ammo, or you'll be left with nothing. Due to this disposable nature, you're allowed to carry up to 4 spares in your inventory. Use them well.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfI don't get it, really don't. How is it that mixing that exploding shit with candy does this? Oh, whatever, I still love every second of it, but the pretty fireworks make me really nostalgic, for some reason...\c-

\cfYou know, one of these days I should take you to see the ones they throw where I live, once you're done saving the world, that is. Think of it as a little gift, for being a good robutt and all.\c-
