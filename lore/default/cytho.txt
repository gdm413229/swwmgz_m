Born in the now fallen Iskar township in 2008 as one of the youngest men of the humble **House Valathor**, **Cytho** took to the family business upon reaching adulthood, quickly climbing the ranks of **Hell**'s sex work industry, partly due to his innate beauty, but also the rapidly accumulating "satisfied customers" he would regularly service, and the many pupils he'd take under his wing. By 2028, he had made of Earth his second home, where he would open up an account on social media for a more modern method of attracting new clientele.

One day, however, everything changed. A large number of incubi would report being "creeped out" by a woman's unreasonable requests. Curious, Cytho would then set forth to try and find her, to see what exactly his colleagues were finding so unreasonable. And that, is how he met **Elena Yanikov XVI**, an **Anarukon** woman "struck by the curse of eternal loneliness", who so desperately wished to find a husband that she eventually resourced to summoning demons and begging for them to marry her. As expected, all of them had rejected her pleas, no matter how hard she tried, as many among demonkind were wary of her kind. Cytho, however, took pity on her, and accepted, on one condition: They would have to go on a date first.

Some time later, the archduke announced his retirement from sex work, having "reformed" as the faithful husband to an Anarukon woman. While his friends and family celebrated, others saw this as an affront. House Valathor was heavily criticised for not rejecting him right there and then, to the point a small war broke out, as the rival **House Irishtanar** would crush their hometown in "protest". That day, Cytho closely witnessed the cruelty of his own kind, as the sole survivor of that massacre.

Since then, he lives in Boston with his wife and their three children. His social media account's purpose has been shifted to communicating the news of what transpires in his home realm, sourced from the many contacts he's gathered over the years, as representative of the subjugated civilian population. Although the vast majority of Earth's population would not take him seriously, not until the **Demon Invasion** of 2148 began.

Denouncing the **UAC**'s involvements, he posted about the events on **Phobos** and **Deimos** long before the UAC had made them public, and proclaimed that an invasion on Earth was imminent. Still few took him seriously, but one among them was his friend **Saya Miyamoto**, of **Akari Labs**. As investor in her company, he had already ensured beforehand that she would have the resources and manpower needed for the task he'd ask of her: Build a combat robot that can fight the invaders.

And thus, through their collaboration, the **Demolitionist** was born.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfSince the very moment I met him, back when I first visited Ellen-san's family, I knew he was more than just a cool, handsome femboy demon grandpa. Yeah, Cytho-sama's the real deal, and the blood that runs through his veins is more noble than that of any pesky, pompous trashlord with a fancy title out there.\c-

\cfAnd yeah, surprise surprise... He's your dad (well, kinda). But you already knew that, didn't you?\c-

\cfSeriously, if it wasn't for him, all of this would have never been possible. We owe a lot to him... I just hope I don't have to repay him with my body (not that I would mind, kihihihi).\c-

\cfPS: His name is pronounced "Kaizo", you kept saying it wrong every time. But don't worry, you're not the first.\c-
