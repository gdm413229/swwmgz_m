The **Demolitionist** is one of the crowning achievements of **Akari Labs** on the field of robotics. An AI-driven combat unit capable of efficiently utilizing any weaponry at its disposition, highly resilient to damage and capable of operating in any environment, including the void of space. It can be seen as the spiritual successor of the **Red Oni** supersoldier program, in a way, as it also serves the same purpose of defending Earth from an overwhelming invading force.

Each unit is equipped with various third-party components of note, such as the **JetBurst™ Impulsors** on their backs, allowing them to perform rapid mid-air boosts and dashes, a pair of **Hammerspace™** containers, giving them quick access to a wide arsenal, the two being attached to the all-popular **Symnatek Magnetic Utility Belt**, or the powerful **Celestine Microfusion Battery**, courtesy of **Tach-Engine Technology Institute**, which provides up to 80 days of autonomy for the unit, at full processing power of its **Nekuratek IK-349 CPU**. More details on the full hardware specifications can be found at the Akari Labs website.

The AI core of the Demolitionist is built on the same technology as Akari Labs' **Maidbots**, the **Nekuronbot AI Framework**, which had been provided to **Saya Miyamoto** herself as a gift of friendship from **Zanaveth Nekuraku II**, the lead AI engineer and current CEO of **Nekuratek**. Thanks to this technology, and combined with many other features such as the **CuteEmotion Display** that allows the unit to visibly show emotion through a set of simple animated faces or the **Loudboi Voicebox** that allows it to speak almost naturally, the Demolitionist is barely indistinguishable from a real person in its behavior and emotional response, making interaction with civilians much more comforting. It can even be said that the Demolitionist has its own little personality, with unique quirks and all.

The first unit, affectionately known as **Demo-chan** by Saya, was deployed in June of 2148 on **Union States** territory in order to combat the demonic invasion brought upon by the **UAC**'s interventions on **Hell**.

Of this previously mentioned first unit, there are many details known thanks to a Q&A session that Saya had livestreamed months prior to the deployment. The unit has been acknowledged as being part of the Miyamoto household, having the full name of **Demo Miyamoto**, and being referred to by Saya as her "child". Demo can be described as "quite chatty" and fond of joking around to try and put a smile on people's faces, but also very serious and determined in their desire to protect those in need. They are also quite popular within the LGBTQIA+ community due to their fierce support of also protecting the rights of those who face discrimination for their identities, and has even publicly come out themself as non-binary. This didn't really come as a surprise to most due to Saya's own involvements with the collective, however.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfHeh, yeah... that stream was fun. People asked so many questions, and your answers sure caught some of them by surprise, huhu...\c-

\cfBy the way, there is also one more thing that makes you unique. It's that "lucky collar" I made for you, you know. Ibuki had one, and it sure helped her, so I thought that it was a good idea to give it to you too. Wish people weren't going all "wow you gave them that BDSM thing?", though. IT IS NOT, it has NOTHING to do with that.\c-

\cfAnyway, if you're finished reading about yourself, how about you get back to work? Yes, Demo-chan, I know you are reading this, at this very moment. OoOOoOoOoOooo... spooky, isn't it?\c-

\cfGet back to work, you silly robutt.\c-

Following their success in fighting off Hell's armies, Saya realized that no other units would ever need to be made, so Demo themself became the "ultimate weapon" of Akari Labs, all by their lonesome. Furthermore, they were additionally rewarded with a separate Maidbot frame, which Demo freely makes use of during their free time, and has allowed them to truly express their feelings for Saya, becoming her third partner, together with Maidbot and Ibuki.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfYou're so cute, Demo-chan. I really outdid myself with that Maidbot body, for sure. It seriously caught me by surprise when, as soon as you swapped over to it, you just... jumped in my arms like that and started kissing me all over and... whew~\c-

\cfI'm really happy that you're now part of our little Cutie Club (\c-\cg♥\c-\cf), you know. And yeah, I didn't want to just go around swapping it too so I did make a second collar for you to wear. Hey, come on, I'm still saying it's got nothing to do with some sort of BDSM kink or anything.\c-

\cfAnyway, no more reading about yourself while you're working. Go away, silly.\c-
