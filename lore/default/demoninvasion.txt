Sometime in 2145, following a coup staged by the leaders of **Hell**'s armed forces, the **Anarukon**-led **Kuriste Royal Family** was overthrown and the leading general **Erebus Arthamuz** set himself as new leader of the realm, claiming to "finally liberate our kind from the tyranny of the undying", and effectively established a military dictatorship. Around this time, the **UAC** was conducting several explorations of the realm in order to study it and potentially set up trade routes for valuable materials, especially sources of **Ardent Energy**. The idea of humans treading on their territory and wishing to exploit their resources was most definitely not welcome, especially considering the fact us humans have shunned Demonkind for countless millennia. What followed was a declaration of war (see **"Hell"** entry for more details).

Following their first incursions in the UAC's Mars bases, which had been kept a close-guarded secret, a whistleblower revealed in early 2148 what had happened, and their next plan of invading **Earth**. While some had their doubts about such a thing, others took these threats very seriously, and prepared for impending doom. One among these was **Akari Labs**, a Japanese robotics company, which initiated the **Demolitionist** program in order to combat the invasion. The project was ready by June, being deployed on the 6th of the same month on **Union States** soil (an event which caused certain discontent due to this act being a clear violation of the **White Scar Treaty** as the Demolitionist heavily employs **Nukuri** technology).

Although some territories could easily fend off the invaders (some coming out exceptionally unscathed, such as the **Soviet Union**, **Japan**, **Australia** and the **Union of African Republics**), the worldwide impact has been devastating, with casualties adding up to millions, especially on territories of the **Americas**, where the UAC's influence is more pronounced. Outside help is practically nonexistent, as the invaders have managed to cut all communication with allied worlds, keeping them in the dark regarding our situation. The only hope left is for Earth's own forces to fight back. Several armies across the world, as well as countless specialized mercenaries, have been documented to rise up against the Demons, including the UAC's own marine corps, among them, the "lone marine" that had survived the attacks on the bases of **Phobos** and **Deimos**. He's been deemed their "trump card" to put an end to the invasion.

Even at the moment of this article's writing, the invasion is still progressing. There have been evacuation efforts to prevent more civilian casualties, while anyone able-bodied takes part in the fight for Earth's salvation.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfI said it in the mission briefing and I say it again: FUCK THE UAC. All this is entirely their fault. They brought this shit upon us all, and we're paying for it.\c-

\cfWe've mourned long enough before the mission, now it's your time to fight. Everyone is fighting, there's shittons of crazy people around, whole-ass one man armies, it's chaos. You know, I do have high hopes that this will all be over soon. Humanity is very strong, we've been through a lot of shit in half a century. We can keep going.\c-

\cfIf there's one thing I can take from all this, after all these years, Demo-chan, is that capitalism is a fucking disease. All this greed, this thirst for power, it only serves to fuel war and death. And, I hate being part of it, but I have to if I want things to change.\c-

In a matter of weeks, the number of invaders thinned as the efforts to fend them off progressed. And then, at the peak of this counterattack, the Demolitionist was finally deployed. In less than a day, they had achieved victory, closing the gate to Hell from the inside and eliminating the commander of the invading army, his severed psychic link causing the death of all forces under his control remaining in Hell. The next day, all the remaining groups on Earth, scattered and without leadership, were suppressed one by one, freeing Earth from the invasion.

Since then, the possibility of further attacks remained. Some wonder if it may be time to take the war to Hell itself, while others focus on reconstruction, and finding ways to prevent them from invading ever again. **Saya Miyamoto** of Akari Labs claims that the main issue has been in the UAC's teleportation technology all along, and its lack of safeguarding against hijacking. Suffice to say, the aftermath of this catastrophe hasn't been very kind on the corporation. After severe sanctions and a restructuring of its board of directors, the UAC completely lost hold of its position of power in the American continent, and has been forced to assume full responsibility for repairing the damages the invasion has caused.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfYeah, fuck the UAC. That manchild Kelliher got what he deserved. Hordes upon hordes of former employees leaving him all alone to bear the weight of all the shit his company has caused. Some of them came up here to the labs, funny enough. We welcomed them with open arms.\c-

\cfThings have started to cool off despite some isolated incidents, although now we have to deal with whatever bullshit is cooking between the Demons and the Xevetha. Honestly, if I could I'd build a million more of you and send them all to tear those filthy usurper generals to shreds, but realistically that can't be done, heh. Maybe I can actually move some strings though, check up on some contacts and see what could be done.\c-

In mid-2160, a new threat had surfaced, but was swiftly dealt with by the **Doom Marine**. After his victory, he chose to remain in Hell to prevent any more incidents. To this day it's unknown if he's still alive, as contacts in Hell have reported that he's gone missing. Five years later, a nation allied to the Kuriste Royal Family sent forth assassins to eliminate the usurper generals one by one. Although they succeeded, this only made things worse, as it gave **Akedas Aximal**, Erebus's right-hand man, the chance to assume control, keeping hold of the realm in the shadows, scheming to take his revenge. His plans, however, were thwarted time and time by the Demolitionist's regular visits to the **Sundered Realms**.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfWe'll get him one day, Demo-chan, I'm sure of it. If it's not us, it'll be someone else. The stuff that happened with those assassins tells me they've got enemies out there, BIG ones. Apparently it was one of those Anarukon "Free Communities" that sent them. I don't know much about that stuff beyond what I wrote in the article for it though.\c-

In May of 2171, following a conversation between Saya Miyamoto and **Azkhan Konomoru**, matriarch of the Kuriste Royal Family, plans were brought forth to put an end to this conflict once and for all, involving the rescue of a demon prince capable of effortlessly slaying the countless armies of Hell still remaining, and reestablishing the peaceful leadership of the Kuriste Royal Family.

\cfUpdate: Haha and now I know everything. EVERYTHING about it. Boy, they're so fucked. You saw, too, we all did. Once we find the missing prince, it's game over for that stupid-ass illusionist schmuck. 9.3 billion demons bred for war? All of them won't stand a chance, it's going to be raining blood for days in hell, if what we heard about him is true.\c-
