The **Divine Sprite** is a crystallization of life-giving power produced by the demigod **Klokonie**, who is said to be able to revive the long dead, and even build them new bodies if lost. They have done this many times, sometimes going as far as to create new life from pure nothingness. Among other things, their teachings have assisted the ancient **Izuna** race in the creation of **Chimeras**.

This shining gem invigorates even the puniest of mundane creatures when crushed firmly in their hands, both soul and body overflowing with vitality. Its effects, however, are not permanent, as neither body nor soul are capable of truly containing so much life force.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfThis thing reminds me of the "lifegems" from... That game (we don't talk about that one). The big difference is that they don't suck and aren't redundant nonsense.\c-

\cfAs you may expect, this is also another thing that my god buddies have recommended. Normally these are only provided to heroes by special request... And you are our hero, Demo-chan, so this is for you.\c-

\cfPS: Don't try to eat it.\c-
