The **Doom Marine** is the lone survivor of the demonic invasions on the **UAC** bases of Phobos and Deimos. Having been transferred to **Mars City** not long before the initial incidents, he was part of the detachment sent to defend the Phobos bases from the invading demons who had somehow hijacked the teleportation systems the UAC was experimenting with. Following this impressive feat of, as a one man army, fighting off the invaders on both Phobos and Deimos, along with taking the fight to **Hell** itself and coming back, he was appointed as the organization's "problem solver".

At the moment of this article's writing, the marine has been tasked with fighting the demon invaders who have appeared on Earth. Most have faith in his success, seeing him as a truly unstoppable demon slaying machine, but others have criticized the UAC's decision to send just one single individual to deal with such a large scale invasion, among them **Saya Miyamoto** of **Akari Labs**, who instead opted to place her bets on her own creation, the **Demolitionist**.

\cfAlright, IMPORTANT THING: don't get close to this guy, don't say anything to him, do not interact. If you two come across each other, stand back and let him work, or he might just go and start shooting you too.\c-

\cfBy the way, my congratulations to those UAC goons for how well-guarded they keep all the info about him. We don't even know his actual goddamn name, or his history from before all this shit started. Like, what even is this guy like? I haven't heard much of that, apart from the little info Cytho-sama could get out of his previous romp through Hell, but there was some mention of him liking rabbits? Cute bunnies?\c-

\cfWell, maybe then, if you pretend those horns of yours are some bun ears, he might not shoot you on sight, who knows...\c-

Despite this "defeat", the UAC continued to make use of the Doom Marine for many other demon slaying missions. He was eventually decommissioned by the end of 2149, seeing as no further attempts were made by Hell to attack humanity once again.

\cfDude's pretty much retired, and boy is it a well deserved rest. He's been into deeper shit than you, being the one to survive all that stuff on Mars and then being thrown around random places to "save the day". Last I heard, from Cytho-sama's own words, he had to deal with two other titans that the demon armies had in store. Both pretty much standing at the same level as ol' Baramun.\c-

\cfWhat surprised me the most is hearing what he said in an interview. That he has no hard feelings about you stealing the spotlight back then, seems to be a fan of your work, even, saying you're "damn fine at ripping and tearing demon guts". Neat.\c-

He was eventually decommissioned by the end of 2149, seeing as no further attempts were made by Hell to attack humanity once again. This didn't last forever, though, as in 2160, a new threat was discovered, a **Mother Demon** had risen to power, replacing the Icon of Sin and reviving the armies that were once defeated. The Doom Marine was immediately re-commissioned and sent to put a stop to this. Following his success in defeating the Mother Demon, he sent one last transmission, noting that he would "stay in Hell to make sure no demon ever comes out again". Ever since then, no further communication has been possible with him.

\cfI asked trusty ol' Cytho-sama if he knew what the the dude is up to. Basically, what he knows is that, after making a big fucking mess of Hell, even kicking the asses of some of the lesser Demon Generals (nice), one of the big "archdemon" guys, the one that's a fat ugly bastard, poofed him away "out of this universe" as soon as he got close.\c-

\cfSo, that's how the story ends. He's just gone, forever, and those fucks are still running Hell. BUT... I was also told that without anyone left to command their legions they're basically losing control of everything, and might be overthrown soon. Good.\c-
