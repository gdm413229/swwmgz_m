Born in Boston in 2066, to **Elena Yanikov XIX** and **Gottfried Steiner**, **Ellen** is the younger of two sisters (both of them are named Elena). This oddity of all women in her family sharing the same name can be traced back to **Elena Yanikov I**, born in 1703, who made this decision, out of some superstitious belief that it would "preserve their immortality forever". This was not far off from the truth, however, but it had nothing to do with inheritance of names. It has been verified that **Anarukon** genes are fully preserved across all female descendants, no matter how many generations, especially so for those from the Yanikov lineage.

From a young age she showed quite the interest in "exploring" every corner of the city, first starting with just nearby abandoned buildings, then further expanding to pretty much any point of interest she could identify in the whole city. She began recording her urban explorations while still in elementary school, and uploading them to video sharing sites, earning quite a lot of popularity.

In the aftermath of the **White Scar**, Ellen used the skills she had gained in exploration to work as a scavenger alongside her mother, scouring the wasteland for valuable resources to bring back to the various shelters in the area. Through this she eventually met **Ibuki Miyamoto**, the **Red Oni**, who had wandered the wastes for many years, becoming a "legendary warrior" of sorts due to her various feats. In the process of Ibuki being recalled back to Japan by **Taro Miyamoto**, of **Akari Labs**, Ellen decided that she wanted to go with them, citing that "wandering around this dump is really boring anyway and I really want to see the world out there".

During her stay in Japan, she'd often spend her time with Taro, the two of them eventually dating some weeks after. Something which was followed by an announcement from Taro on social media citing: "my wizard privileges have been revoked".

Apart from her shared ancestry with renowned Gothic Rock singer/guitarist **Ashley Knox**, she also shares a much closer relation to her due to the fact her father is the grandson of Ashley's ex-husband, the late **Fredrik Steiner**. Through this, and the fact they both are engaged to members of the Miyamoto family, they have become quite close. Ellen has even considered joining the band at some point, though as of this article's writing, this hasn't yet happened.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfHeh, typical of Taro nii-san, announcing to the whole damn world that he lost his fucking virginity. He really couldn't be any more subtle about it if he tried. So yeah, between him and Yu-chan, the two have scored themselves some immortal cuties, making me jealous as all fuck in the process. Like, seriously, how the fuck could ANYONE even want to date my absolute loser of a brother? I don't know what Ellen-san sees in him...\c-

\cfOh yeah, speaking of Ellen-san. She's a goddamn massive prankster, like, the most awfully skilled troll you could ever imagine, even. See, there was this one time... actually, I think I'll keep quiet about it, because it was embarrassing as all hell. My ass is still sore from back then. I'm NOT going to explain, fuck no. Use your imagination, Demo-chan.\c-

\cfAh, also, one super good thing about having her around. She's got some interesting connections. Yeah, most people don't know, but her gramps is a demon. Like, actual demon, from Hell and all. Some real cutie too. Name's Cytho Valathor, and he says he's a "reformed incubus", whatever that means. Whenever I need to know anything about what's going on in the land of fire 'n brimstone, he's the guy I go to.\c-
