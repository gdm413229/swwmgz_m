Founded in 2014 by **J.A. Tachmek-Smith**, the **Tach-Engine Institute** is one of the largest tech corporations on Earth, far above the **UAC**. They were pioneers in the introduction of **Microfusion Technology**, allowing for efficient, clean energy production with minimal resources, although most of this work was adapted and refined from existing **Nukuri** technology.

In a way, Tach-Engine is, both in scale and scope, much like the well known Nukuri tech supergiant **Nekuratek**. Both companies have remained closely associated even after the events of the **White Scar**, as the founder himself managed to negotiate a way out of signing the global treaty that disallowed the use of any Nukuri technology, along with any contact with the Nukuri people themselves. Scotland thus became one of the only two countries (the other being Japan) that still remain allied to them, which has allowed them to vastly surpass the rest of the world in terms of scientific advancements.

In its association with Nekuratek, they have also collaborated several times on many special projects, including an expedition to the barren planet of **Sunkaeze** in 2045, where the ruins of **Decade Mechanics** were discovered. Shortly after this event, the company's founder announced the opening of a new subdivision dedicated to studying and reproducing the works of the defunct company, thus marking Tach-Engine's entry into the arms race.

Of the founder himself, there is not much known. He's not a very outspoken individual, nor truly has much of a public facing personality. After an interview in 2057, there were only more questions to be made about him. He claimed to be over six thousand years old, and also not human. Furthermore, he declared himself to be the "last living king of Egypt".

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfWho'd have thought that the land of skirts and bagpipes would join us in NOT signing that stupid treaty. Quite a world we live in, huh? I don't really talk much about this but we're kinda like... acquaintances of sorts. At least that's what I think, my English may be good, but his accent is really hard to understand at times. You've got some of his own tech in there, Demo-chan, pretty nifty stuff. That battery's going to last you for DAYS, you know, no matter how much you screw around blowing shit up. This "microfusion" stuff's some real damn blessing, that's for sure. Though I feel that maybe it's part of why you're so damn heavy (no, I'm not calling you fat, just heavy).\c-

\cfAnyway, the stuff he said in that interview? Hell, I'd believe it. At this point, I'd just believe pretty much anything. There's aliens everywhere, gods exist, multiple universes, angels, demons, whatever, ANYTHING is possible.\c-
