\cf "Pocket Exploder"\c-

A custom-built semiautomatic handgun designed for proprietary .387 caliber **Explodium** tipped bullets. One of the crowning achievements of its creator, who had initially only made it as a joke, to later find that thousands of people wanted one. After entering mass production, **Munch Innovations** became what it is now thanks to the neverending demand for "pocket exploders".

\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Steady shooting. A direct hit is often lethal, but the splash damage can deal some fine hurt too. Aim at the feet to send smaller targets flying.

\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Performs what's been commonly named an "explosive reload". Each magazine for this weapon has a pin at the bottom, which, when fully pulled, arms it as a grenade, ready to throw at your enemies. The explosive yield of each mag is proportional to the number of bullets left inside. Obviously, this action can only really be performed if you have at least one bullet still left, otherwise nothing will come of it.

\cfReloading:\c- Normal reload, nothing will explode here, as when not armed, the magazines are practically indestructible.

\cfThis one's on my main, level three-eighty-seven.\c-

\cfOK I doubt you'll get the reference, but fuck it, I felt like saying it. Anyway, ancient memes aside... I got a deal going with the guy, and you pretty much have an endless supply of ammo for this thing, so feel free to waste away. Just don't be a dummy and put an armed mag back in your Hammerspace, nerdboy will get really fucking pissed if everything blows up, y'know.\c-
