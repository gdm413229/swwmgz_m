The **Hand of Divine** was a weapon that the god **Korovithuhcp** constructed countless millenia ago, and had been passed down among many heroes of legend. Eventually it was lost, and the god had no interest in building a new one. This, obviously, did not stop **Misa Unissix** from attempting to do exactly just that. Following historical records of its use, she built her own version through a blend of arcane magic and modern technology. She gifted one to her daughter, **Zanaveth Nekuraku III**, and another to the **Demolitionist**.

\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Charges up a punch, and then releases it. The gauntlet will fling itself forward and then return to you.

\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Charges up a wide arc slap. On release this will very loudly and violently whack all targets in front of you.

\cfTechniques:\c- Due to its nature, the Hand of Divine is susceptible to the effects of a **Ragekit**, increasing its strength and range.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfMan that sure was a special delivery from Zana-chan. And when we showed that it was good, and fun, Misa-Misa got all excited and started mass-producing them. She's just too adorable, I swear.\c-

\cfAnyway, those fiends are gonna get knocked the fuck out with this thing. Can't wait to see it in action on real targets. Especially after... that incident with the punching bag.\c-
