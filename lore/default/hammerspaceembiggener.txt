\cf Storage Expansion Contract\c-

When **Hammerspace™** containers first started being commercialized, **Cyrus Enterprises** hadn't yet decided on how to handle the needs of those who might not be quite satisfied with the standard storage capacity provided to each customer.

Each of these **Hammerspace™ Embiggener** cards is completely unique, and only available for purchase from Cyrus Enterprises themselves. Customers can expand their storage limit up to sixteen times with these, which should be enough even for the needs of large armies seeking to store their weapons and ammo efficiently.
