**Hell** is a vast world separate from our own, but still contained within our Universe. In its inception, it was known as **Kur**, a peaceful world that the **Anarukon** people led out of **Novoskhana** by **Noskas Kurenai** had sought as the "promised land" where they would live in peace away from the tyranny of the **Eternal Empress**. The peace lasted for almost three thousand years, until the **Betrayal of Father Nostros** happened in 10,675 BC, wherein one of the descendants of the **Nine Kings** of Kur brought with himself a seemingly endless army of creatures who could only be described as "demons" and decided to take the whole land for himself and his new "followers". Ever since then, the land of Kur has become what can only be described as "Hell", under the reign of Nostros as its "supreme leader".

In 149, following the disappearance of prince heir **Manakei**, who had been summoned to Earth but never returned, internal conflicts arose within the ranks of Hell's royalty. These fights for the succession of the throne, however, never truly escalated as long as Nostros was there to keep the demons at bay. Many attempts were made to locate the heir and bring him back, unsuccessfully.

In 2145, after the supreme leader of Hell suddenly left the throne for unexplained reasons, leaving only his son, the inexperienced **King Akusei** in charge, the various archdemons, corrupt generals of the demon armies, took the chance to stage a coup and overthrow the main royal family, forcing them into exile. This event unfortunately coincided closely with the **UAC**'s first explorations of Hell. Although curious at first about these odd beings that had entered their realm, they made the decision of exterminating them once they began to show an interest in exploiting their natural resources and in addition had shown hostility when approached. They were almost successful in this, but their plans for sending a full fleet to our own world were swiftly stopped along with their initial invasion of **Mars City**, and couldn't be truly realized until much later, in 2148, when they managed to hijack the UAC's teleporters on Phobos and Deimos, completely overtaking both moon bases and even managing to pull in one of the two moons into their own realm. Following retaliation from a lone soldier, the **Doom Marine**, they set their sights on Earth, and thus their final invasion began.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfOK, first of all, big thanks to Ellen-san's gramps for the info we could get on this. Cytho-sama is like, our only contact with that fucking place, and you won't even believe the things he's told me.\c-

\cfFor example, did you know that not everyone in there is "the root of all evil"? Obviously, there's all those bloodthirsty demons that blindly follow the generals and are hellbent (heh) on bringing death and suffering, but... there's also a whole lot of "civilian" demons who just want to live in peace over there. People just like Cytho-sama himself, basically. A whole lot of people who are completely in disagreement with all the shit that's going on, but can't really do anything about it.\c-

\cfNow, of course, you may be thinking: "but aren't all demons supposed to be evil"? And see, the problem here, is in the naming. Words can really change how you think about stuff and all, yeah. Terms like "monster" or "demon" make you think of baddies and shit, but what if they aren't? People are all "oh they're demons, from Hell", and yeah sure, the first thing that comes to mind is obviously that they're evil because that's what we've all been made to believe. But here's the BIG thing: those are names US humans gave them, immediately after the first contact was made, just because that was the impression everyone got.\c-

\cfThe inhabitants of Kur have a different name for themselves, that has nothing to do with Hell nor demons nor anything, they're the Kuriste, meaning "forever scorned". The whole story here is that they were creatures scattered all over the universe that suffered persecution by others for their "monstrous" appearance, and this Nostros guy basically decided to travel around the world bringing them all together under his protection. Sure, he kicked everyone out when he came back, but it was to give them a place to live. Still hate the guy, though. You have to be SERIOUSLY incompetent to go and just leave, letting the worst scum take over and do ALL of this. If I could meet this guy, I'd fucking... just... kick his guts into paste.\c-

Following retaliation from a lone soldier, the **Doom Marine**, they set their sights on Earth, bringing forth all of their legions, under the command of **Baramun**, the Titan of the East, who was given the title of **Icon of Sin**.

Against all odds, humanity prevailed, and the invaders were defeated, along with their leader. Despite this major defeat, the demon generals organized several other attacks, using their remaining forces, but failed once more. Having realized that humanity was far more resilient than they could ever have imagined, they gave up.

Despite this major defeat, the demon generals organized several other attacks, using their remaining forces, but failed once more. Having realized that humanity was far more resilient than they could ever have imagined, they gave up. That is, until around August of 2160, when two demonic necromancers, the **Resurrector Sisters**, made their appearance, and brought back to life all those who had fallen, prompting the UAC to recommission their "problem solver" once again, who made his way back towards Hell, exterminating the revived demons and swiftly eliminating both of the Resurrector Sisters. Once his initial rampage was over, he sent one final message back to Earth, saying that he had sworn to remain in Hell forever, in order to ensure that the demons would never attempt to attack humanity ever again.

The Doom Marine spent his days fighting the remaining demon armies on Hell, eventually defeating all of the remaining commanders. Seeing that there was no way to stop this lone human's rampage, the archdemon generals devised a plan to instead "make him leave". When the marine entered the capital city of **Dis**, with the clear intent to kill them, he fell straight into their trap. **Erebus**, the leading general, took this opportunity to banish him, as far away as he could, far beyond even the outer limits of this Universe, so that he could never have a chance to return.

Despite these massive losses, along with the return of Father Nostros and the unexpected assassination of the archdemon generals, one last threat remains: The hidden schemer **Akedas Aximal**, former right hand man of Erebus, who now rules over Hell in the shadows. No one has been able to find his true hiding place, and still billions of demons are at his command to prevent the exiled royal family from restoring peace. The only hope left is that of the eventual return of Manakei, who is the only demon strong enough to suppress these innumerable hordes.

\cfAnother Update: OK so, you know we met that Nostros guy at the wedding, right? And surely, I did do exactly what I had promised. I kicked him in the gut as hard as I could, over and over until his wife begged me to stop. Yeah, that's the thing, his wife, Azkhan, the "Matriarch of Hell". I had a bit of a private chat with her the next day. And she was really happy to hear of my plans. Ye... happy big goat lady. I've been thinking that, if I bring Azkhan with me when I run the search for that prince guy, it might be easier to bring him back. Y'know, maybe he'll answer goatmom's call or something. They never actually bothered to try that in the first place, even though it's like... real obvious.\c-
