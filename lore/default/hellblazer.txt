The **Hellblazer** is the third incarnation of the **Hellfire Cannon**, one of the many weapons that **Imanaki Corp** had constructed based on their experiments with harnessing what they called **Ardent Energy**, a power source from the depths of **Hell** itself. It is a direct improvement of the Mark 2 model, the **Hellrazer**, being much easier to reload thanks to its simple drum magazine system. It also features many more types of ammunition this time:

\cf"Blazer" grenades:\c- The standard ammunition. Highly explosive despite their small size, thanks to the highly condensed Ardent Energy contained within.

\cf"Crackshot" cluster grenades:\c- These burst into smaller grenades which will spread on impact, bouncing around for a short time before detonating.

\cf"Ravager" incendiary grenades:\c- Ravagers release a wave of unrefined Ardent Energy on detonation, covering a very wide area around themselves. Quite useful in tight spaces, where this scorching hot plasma won't dissipate as quickly, thoroughly roasting any targets within.

\cf"Slayer" warheads:\c- A returning favorite from the previous series. These miniature nukes contain within themselves highly enriched Ardent Energy that will cause total devastation in a large radius, bringing swift death to even the highest ranked demons in Hell's armies.

The Hellblazer was discontinued following the destruction of the Imanaki Corp headquarters in 2009, but the **Tach-Engine Technology Institute** had managed to reproduce this weapon following their demise. Replicated models do not actually employ this "Ardent Energy" however, so they are not as destructive as they were meant to be. Rather, they are powered by the highly volatile **Nokron**, one of the two exotic elements involved in the process of Microfusion, as its potential for use in explosives is quite notable.

\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Shoots the loaded ammunition with its propulsion armed and ready.

\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Lobs the loaded ammunition unarmed, as a bouncing grenade.

\cfTertiary Fire:\c- Cycles the ammo type for the next reload.

\cfReloading:\c- During a reload, you may either refill the current mag (quite easy through the **Hammerspace™** container), or swap it out for a different ammo type.

\cfTechniques:\c- The grenades will automatically detonate on proximity to hostile targets, so you may still land the shot even if you merely grazed them. It is unclear how exactly they detect the targets, or know that they are hostile.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cf"Ardent Energy"? What's that? Energy extracted from a demon's ass after it ate too much curry? Whatever, anything coming from Hell is best left untouched, y'know. Just look at what happened to the fucking UAC, going around sticking their paws where they shouldn't.\c-

\cfActually, making the replicas use Nokron was a pretty clever thing. I had no idea that shit exploded. Really makes you think about all the safety mechanisms that go into Microfusion engines, definitely justified if THAT can happen.\c-
