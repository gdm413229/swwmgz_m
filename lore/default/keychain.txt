A simple keychain where you can hold all your keys. Safely attached to your **Utility Belt** so you don't lose them. Currently held keys are automatically tracked, and can be checked in the **Keychain** tab of your **Demolitionist Menu**.

The keychain is additionally decorated with various charms, personally chosen by **Saya Miyamoto**.
