Born in 2080 to **Syrakha Yanikov** and **Azya Xanai**, **Kirin** became the emperor of **Akkou** at the young age of 12, having shown great interest in following the steps of his mother.

Despite having the title of "Emperor", he actually holds no real power over the people of Akkou, and instead acts more like a political and economical advisor. As a matter of fact, the **Sykhai Empire** couldn't be described as an empire either. Most would describe it as something closer to a collection of anarchist communes than anything else, unlike the actual, tyrannical **Empire of Novoskhana** that they had seceded from.

For almost 80 whole years as the leader of Akkou, Kirin had remained single, as no one dared to approach him with the intention of marrying, for he was revered as an icon of "untarnished purity", in part due to his own name, Kirin, meaning "innocence" in the **Anarukon** language. It wasn't until a chance meeting with **Saya Miyamoto** in 2171 that this eventually changed. The two got married (\cg功c-) in May 8th of 2171, with their union marking the beginning of a great alliance between mankind and the Anarukon, additionally helping heal the old wounds of the **Hellbound Incident**, as this alliance extended to the **Kurenai Kingdom** too, through the shared friendship with **Queen Andreki Anderken**.

Kirin himself can be described as a rather "down to earth" leader. Being quite close to the people of Akkou, and fond of making friends. He is also absolutely adorable. When not attending his duties as advisor of the people, Kirin engages in many of his hobbies, such as painting (being quite skilled at drawing portraits, for example), or the practice of magic alongside his mother. He is also quite fond of videogames, anime, and many other forms of modern entertainment, and is often seen talking extensively on social media about the subject, happily introducing the people of Earth to popular games and shows from his homeworld.

\cfI just can't stop thinking about him when he's not here... or hell, even when he IS here (guess what). Kirin-kun is just... nggghh... I'm going to go hug him right now.\c-

\cfOh he says hi by the way. I told him this isn't a live chat but whatever, hi from our cute husband. Wait, actually... gonna let him write stuff here, why the hell not.\c-

\caHello, Demo-chan. I hope you are doing well in your adventures. I wish I could attend the live stream that Sayacchi makes of this, but I am currently a bit busy withghfghfdgsddfh\c-

\caMy apologies, Saya tickled me. I wish she wouldn't do that when I'm in the middle of writing. As I was attempting to say before that interruption, I'm busy with some important work, but I really would have wished to watch you instead, I am really curious about what you do out there, fighting for justice and helping those in need. Sayacchi makes it all sound so exciting...\c-

\caI hope that you return to us soon once your mission is completed. I'd be very happy to spend more time with you and Sayacchi, together. Please stay safe, Demo, my beloved.\c-

\cfAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA Oh my god that's so adorable!!!!\c-

\cfhehe, yeah, I did go straight for his feet again. His weak spot, huhuhu~\c-

\cfBTW don't tell him but... that "important work" he's busy with? It's actually just another game I got him to play. Seriously, it's been only a couple weeks and he's almost finished my whole library. Forget what he said about not watching you though, I'm definitely going to force him to if necessary. I really want to see how he reacts to your wacky antics.\c-
