**Eushura Kmonn Jr.**, son of **Eushura Kmonn Sr.**, is a skilled inventor from the **Kingdom of Xekke**, in the planet of **Ixxeney**. From a young age he was raised to achieve the same grand goals as his father, and it wasn't long until he managed to earn his own fame after years of working under him as an assistant. His creativity and imagination knew no bounds, and he's been credited with a grand total of 279 major achievements in the fields of both offensive and defensive military technology, which has helped strengthen the kingdom's forces, making them one of the most trusted and requested across the **X'Animen Coalition** for allied defense tasks.

Among some of his most notable creations, there's the **Ray-Khom**, the standard-issue weapon for Xekkian soldiers, the **Isonomic Motor**, which powers the FTL engines of all coalition ships and the **Elemental Coating**, a semi-magical protection device for use in extreme environments.

Alongside his father, he was one of the many engineers behind the famous **K79-D Metareality Driver** project. A weapon of legend whose name is well known by many, but none remember what it did, not even those involved in its creation.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfWow this guy is OLD. I know that those peeps live for thousands of years but, wow, that's even more than the old man from Tach-Engine.\c-

\cfOh yeah, the article mentions the K79-D. Real fucking weird shit there. I actually DO know what happened to it, because Maruku-sama told me, since she was present, and is a god and all that. Apparently the weapon tried to directly violate causality during the test fire, so a "self-preservation mechanism" of the universe flipped out and it was erased instantly along with all the info on how it was created (even going as far as doing memory wipes, holy fuck).\c-
