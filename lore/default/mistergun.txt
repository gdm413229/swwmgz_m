The **Mortal Rifle** was devised in the early 2100s by students of the **University of Nos-Kora** who thought there were simply too many different guns by different armies of different species, so... They would make something that'd be truly "universal" for everyone.

It is chambered in a peculiar 4.44x44.4mm caliber, sporting a barrel length of 44.4cm, and employs odd square shaped ammunition, the nature of which, along with its firing mechanisms, are an enigma. These compact, high-explosive telescoped rounds pack more power in them than the ammunition of most human-made battle rifles of higher calibers. In addition, it also employs 44.4mm grenades from an under-barrel lobber. These grenades burst into lesser target-seeking bombs on impact, making them ideal for scattered targets.

\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Steady shooting of the primary ammunition.

\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Launches an under-barrel grenade. If empty, loads a new one.

\cfTertiary Fire:\c- Alternates between operation modes for the rifle. Switching between "precision shot" (standard semi-auto), "cluster shot" (somehow behaving like a shotgun with the same ammunition), "stream shot" (behaves like full auto but appears to shoot four bullets per bullet?), and "overpressure shot" (somehow appearing to "charge" the ammunition before firing it out with higher potency and velocity).

\cfReload:\c- Does what you'd expect.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfAt this point I can't even be bothered to be confused by anything that comes out of there, seriously.\c-

\cfThis thing is an assault rifle, a shotgun, a machine gun and an anti-tank rifle all in one, with the same exact ammo. And it makes no sense, sure, but it works, however it does.\c-

\cfDon't get too comfortable with it, by the way. I bet once it starts to grow on you you won't be able to go back to any other weapon.\c-
