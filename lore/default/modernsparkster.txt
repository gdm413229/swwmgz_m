The **Sparkster** began as an attempt by **Tach-Engine Technologies** to replicate the energy weapons of the defunct **Decade Mechanics**. The first two prototypes were a failure, as it was seen that there was no way to create anything even remotely resembling Biosparks, a semi-sentient form of energy ammunition.

Then, a breakthrough came: Why try to copy something that can't ever be truly understood? Why not keep the same internal principles of the weapon but employ different, easily obtainable ammunition? And thus, the "modern" Sparkster lineup was born. Employing high-density **Nokron** and **Kinylum** plasma charges, the x3 series can reach the same destructive potential as heavy artillery, with lesser weight, size, and hassle of operation.

\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Hold to charge a glob of Kinylum plasma, release to let it out into the world. The destructive potential is relatively small, but has a notable lingering burn both across the path it takes, and in a dense cloud where it impacted.

\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Hold to charge a glob of Nokron plasma, release to let it out into the world. While more immediately destructive than the primary ammunition, this one is less stable, and tends to come out as a searing blast, rather than a projectile.

\cfPrimary Reload:\c- Load in a Kinylum cell. Up to 3 can be held in reserve.

\cfSecondary Reload:\c- Load in a Nokron cell. Same reserve capacity.

\cfTechniques:\c- Projectile charge can be held indefinitely, as the weapon will vent regularly to stabilize the weapon's peak ignition potency. This could allow one to simply charge from cover and pop out to release the shot when needed. Additionally, the possibility to press both triggers at once is also documented, which allows for a potent release of Nokorokinylum plasma, comparable to a miniature nuke in destructive potential. It is not recommended to perform a combined attack unless the target is far away enough so as to not endanger the user.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfYooooooooo this is the shit right here. It's kind of a pre-war relic, but it works so well that the x4 and x5 models are apparently just minor revisions of it, from what the old man told me. We can't have the new ones due to some deep White Scar Treaty fuckery, sadly, so this one will do.\c-

\cfThis is seriously so cool, tho. It's basically a plasma rocket launcher and shotgun all in one. Also don't get me started on the design, it's so futuristic and sleek... That's kinda the thing with Nekuratek, really. God it's making me nostalgic for the olden days when I actually got to visit Nahkami and saw their factories and stuff and everything was so bright and clean... Oh man.\c-
