**Nedoshiaan** is a dead world, once ruled by a mad dictator of the same name, millions of years ago. As the stories go, this "tyrant god" was assassinated by one of his most trusted associates, in a suicidal attack that resulted in the massive crater that reaches deep into the planet's frozen core. Very few survived, who still live to this day, and witness accounts are rather bare.

In 793 BC, an expedition by **Devanikan** adventurers resulted in the discovery of several artifacts at the very bottom of this crater. These were the so-called **Artifacts of Nedoshiaan**, a set of weapons devised by the dictator god himself and created by his loyal engineer **Nukurines Mei Mess**, who among others had all survived this incident and no longer wished to associate themselves with it. These artifacts were immediately put under the protection of the **Unissix Clan**, and to this day they tightly control any research and reproduction of them.

Only four artifacts were found, of the five that had been allegedly constructed. It's widely accepted that this fifth artifact was the one responsible for the death of the deity, and had been lost in the process. The known artifacts are as follows:

\cfMykradvo:\c- Also known as the **Great Anomaly**, an orb of pure energy that, in the hands of a single individual, would allow them to smite all around them in an instant. Its power is, however, very limited, and a great deal of time is needed for it to recharge itself after use, making it more of a last resort weapon for emergencies.

\cfKyshyje:\c- The **Amulet of Misfortune** that, when worn by an individual, would bring absolute destruction and madness to all those who desired to harm them. At least, that's what it was meant to do, as once tested, it appeared to instead attract misfortune to whoever wore it, perhaps as a sign of them not being "worthy" of wearing it, as some theorized.

\cfYnykron:\c- Known by most as the **Death Cannon**. One of two surviving artifacts that could be counted as an actual, physical weapon. Fueled by the "essence of countless tortured souls", it is capable of channeling it all into an unstoppable beam of energy that tears through space-time, erasing from existence anything it comes in contact with.

\cfNekrodero:\c- One artifact that has been forbidden from ever being used, due to the very nature of its operation, and the effects it has on those who are struck by it. Details on what exactly it does are impossible to obtain, but it has been described as "the most abhorrent display of cruelty that not even the most twisted of minds could have imagined".

\cfInshtrometanykha:\c- The fifth and missing artifact, the **God Slayer**. Named this due to the fact this was the only known weapon that could actually destroy a god across the three layers of existence. Its effectiveness is very clear, taking into account what happened. Only two deities survived the blast, having been just grazed by it, however one became unable to take on a physical form, requiring an artificial body, and the other suffered severe damages that have put them in a "deep sleep".

Of these artifacts, the **Ynykron** was successfully reproduced and re-engineered for more "mundane" use, after **Misa Unissix** obtained its original blueprints from Mei Mess himself. Its usage still is very strictly controlled, of course.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfDictator gods, weapons of ultimate destruction, "fueled by tortured souls"... This shit's crazy, seriously. This fucking world never runs out of ridiculous ways to surprise me.\c-

\cfOh yeah, props to Misa for letting us use that thing, by the way. Sure, it's not as "world-ending" as the original (supposedly), but it still beats the UAC's prized "BFG", by a huge margin, holy shit.\c-
