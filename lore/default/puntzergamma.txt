The **Puntzer** series of weapons from **Blackmann Arms** are prime examples of the potential of their patented **Spin Motion Wedge (SMW)** perforating ammunition.

The **Puntzer Gamma** is a mostly compact bullpup submachine gun featuring a horizontal mag loading system akin to 21st century classics like the **Herschel Model 1990**. The weapon is additionally capable of delivering "Fuller Auto" ultra-rapid fire, as seen is many other automatic weapons of Blackmann Arms manufacture.

\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Shoots the weapon.

\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Cycles fire modes, between single shot, 3-round burst, full auto and fuller auto.

\cfReloading:\c- Reloads, as expected. Your **Hammerspace™ Container**'s autoloaders will provide you with a fresh mag every time.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfMy legs are OK.\c-

\cfIn all seriousness, that's pretty cool. Very fast gun that shoots very spinny drill bullets. What kind of license do you even need to use this in any situation other than a demonic invasion? There's no way something this ridiculous could be legal otherwise.\c-

\cfBy the way I just realized something: SMW bullets are 6.9mm.\c-

\cfNice.\c-
