A powerful incendiary weapon coming from **Kmonn Shuna**, prized among **Xekkian** commanders. The **Quadravol** shoots blazing balls of fire that explode spectacularly in contact with anything, releasing intense heat and kinetic force. It is seen to be very useful against crowds as the force of impact is potent enough to disperse them quickly. One very distinctive trait of the weapon is the fact that the flames that burst out of it will burn brightly even underwater.

The name of the weapon comes from the **Xekkas** language, and it stands for **"Ardent Cross"**. This name is taken from a verse of the old legend of the heroic general **Antikalapsus**, who in 17381 BC defeated the **Inshta Ereuma** and his **Ministry of Destruction**. As the verse narrates:

\cf"Saida shuna hoskaxar ter quadravol sundara vostoshakera serai, doro ultirukoda bos naaxakka ter usosmodu bura tasaskil."\c-

\cf(For the flames of the ardent cross spread throughout the horde, and cleansed this holy land of the corruption they had brought.)\c-

The Ardent Cross was the name of the general's sword which, when imbued with magic, would release deadly cross slashes of burning flame.

\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Single, large fireball shot. Very minor drift, so its effective range is quite long. Ignites nearby targets on impact.

\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Pumps additional fuel, increasing the strength of your shots, but also their drift, making them less accurate. Excess overcharge will result in a wildly inaccurate misfire, but even this has its uses. Forcibly pumping in the middle of primary fire engages slamfire, allowing you to shoot rapid low-charge bursts.

\cfTertiary Fire:\c- Toggles a scatter shot mode for primary. Several smaller fireballs (number relative to charge), with increased drift and lower effective range, but very useful against multiple targets.

\cfReloading:\c- Insert up to five fuel cells into the weapon's tube magazine. Each cell is immediately ejected once it's been emptied into the weapon's internal "crucible", so you can hold additional ammo while keeping your charge.

\cfTechniques:\c- The weapon has a certain "extra effective" special move should you be close enough to your target. Plunging the four bayonets into an enemy and immediately pulling the trigger afterwards will result in a potent point blank explosion that will send them flying, covered in flames.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfTypical overly dramatic Xekkian stuff. The "Ardent Cross", really... But it's as badass as it sounds, at least.\c-

\cfAnd of course it's huge af too, even if the grip is supposedly adapted. It honestly weirds me out how you can do that thing of... making your hands bigger, but at least it lets you use stuff like that easily.\c-

\cfAnyway, motherfucking fireballs, that work underwater??? Gonna need to see the science behind this because that makes no fucking sense and yet... it's there.\c-
