Devised by a reportedly "insane" and "derranged" engineer at **Nekuratek**'s Advanced Arms Division, this weapon's development was cut short of its initial ambitious plans. Citing that this engineer whose name won't be revealed "played too many videogames", he was stopped before he could add a whopping 15 different modes of operation to the weapon, rendering it extremely convoluted, costly and "completely ridiculous".

The **Rafan-Kos** project ("Ultimate Weapon" in Nukuribaku) would only be partially completed once chief engineer **Zanaveth Nekuraku I** personally stepped in to ask for this "inanity" to cease. The end result seemed satisfactory enough despite complaints from its creator, and would be eventually commercialized.

The weapon employs **Kabbadon** as fuel, a common byproduct of **Nokorokinylum** fusion, thus making it fairly easy to produce. However, the density and degree of purity required in the creation of a single fuel pod make its price escalate dramatically.

\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Release a radiant blast of energy that punches its way through anything, sending sparks flying in all directions along its path and burning other nearby targets. The blast burns for a total of five seconds before rapidly dissipating.

\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Releases several scattered blasts in a wide cone, with similar destructive potential, but burning quicker, stronger, and dissipating much rapidly.

\cfReload:\c- Loads in a new magazine, each holding four pods.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cf"Ultimate Weapon"? Talk about pretentious... But you know, something about this was making my brains itch, and then it clicked. This is basically like that one spellcard, the Master Spark. Hell, it almost even sounds and looks the same...\c-

\cfThat's fucking cool, actually. I like it, so I put it in the same slot as the other two massive fuckoff guns.\c-
