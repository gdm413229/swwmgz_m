What you see here is an extension of the magic employed in your **Lucky Collar**, repurposed and adjusted to allow you to transport yourself on demand back to the entrance of the current area you're in. This is quite useful to have in case you find yourself trapped in some inescapable room, and have no other resources to break out. The world of **Parthoris** is a treacherous one, as the **Sidhe** would inform us, and so these are a must, and may be found in areas where "trap rooms" have been reported.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfAh, the perfect way to escape from a closed room...\c-

\cfYeah, this is actually based on your collar, works similarly too, except I'm not the one who activates whenever you're in mortal danger, and its effects are more "dramatic" (you'll see). It's simple magic stuff, really. Those idiots at the UAC would shit themselves if they knew we've had the magic to do long distance teleports, even across universes, long before their experiments existed.\c-

It is assumed that **Cronos** may feature the same sorts of traps, so be careful.
