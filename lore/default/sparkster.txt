The **Biospark Carbine**, also known by its nickname of **"Sparkster"**, was the flagship weapon of **Decade Mechanics**, back when it was still active. It is described as being powered by "sentient lightning", although it does not show any signs of being truly electric in nature.

Blueprints were found for all models from the S-1 to S-6 (the latter being in early prototyping stages, and not yet functional), but it proved impossible to truly recreate them. Fortunately, over 30,000 ready-made S-5 units were stockpiled deeply inside the ruined facility in **Sunkaeze**, all ready for use. Currently, **Tach-Engine Technologies** and its associated partners manage the distribution of these units, and are also studying the weapons in detail for potential redesigns and enhancements.

One notable detail about the Biospark Carbine is how its "sentient" energy drives shot projectiles to seek nearby targets, somehow telling apart friend from foe, relative to the weapon's user. Arcs of lightning have a tendency to spread out from them, dealing additional damage.

\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Small blobs of stabilised energy with slight target-seeking abilities. Leave a trail of arcs that gravitate towards them as they move, then spread out on impact, homing on hostile targets.

\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Concentrated, penetrating beam shot. Also has some slight seeking.

\cfTertiary Fire:\c- If the loaded charge is at least at 50%, the containment capsule inside will be ejected through the main barrel and detonated as a massive sphere of pure energy that tracks down nearby targets. The weapon must be reloaded afterwards.

\cfReload:\c- Reloads, obviously.

\cfTechniques:\c- If the secondary beam comes in contact with an energy blob it will be detonated with increased damage and range. This requires precise timing and aim to be truly effective.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfFunny how these rusty-ass things somehow still work. And holy fuck do they work well, too...\c-

\cfI'm also surprised that that nickname caught on. Most people nowadays probably won't even get the reference at all.\c-
