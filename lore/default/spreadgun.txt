\cf Single-shot "Slide-action" Shotgun\c-

The **Spreadgun** is a simple single-shot shotgun with a rather unconventional reload mechanism. Unlike other weapons of the same fashion, the Spreadgun employs an odd variant of break action that **Blackmann Arms** has described as "slide-action", whereas rather than being hinged, the barrel slides horizontally at the press of two side buttons, with a small metal bit springing up and ejecting the loaded shell. After loading in another round, the user merely has to push the barrel back into its closed position. Some have doubts about the practicality of this operation, or its safety, but it's been guaranteed that the gun will not misfire no matter the force exerted to push the barrel back in.

As it is chambered in the rare 10Ga-short type, there's an exclusive assortment of ammunition types it can use, all handled by Blackmann Arms themselves. They are as follows:

\cfStandard Buckshot:\c- Red shells. Exactly what it says on the tin. The spread caused by the shortness of the barrel may make it difficult to reach distant targets, but at close range it should be very effective.

\cfMetal Slug:\c- Green shells. Very potent slugs that have a decent accuracy, even at longer ranges. Due to their size and weight, they can potentially penetrate multiple small targets.

\cfDragon's Breath:\c- White shells. A burst of flame in each shot, has considerable range. Ineffective underwater, for obvious reasons.

\cfKinylum Saltshot:\c- Teal shells. Small chunks of Kinylum in its natural "salt" form. Once shot, they leave a trail of boiling hot plasma that remains in the air for a few moments before finally dissipating. In addition, the chunks will explode violently on contact with any surface, or once they "destabilize" (which unfortunately makes this type of ammunition ineffective at longer distances).

\cfTelebrium Flechettes:\c- Black shells. Dozens of piercing projectiles tipped with pure Telebrium, an exotic element known for its potent corrosive effects when heated. Targets hit by these projectiles will experience a very painful discharge of corrosive toxins through their bodies (even non-organic ones), although the effects of this will dissipate in a couple seconds. Use of this ammunition is highly restricted, but you have been granted permission to use it against the invading forces.

\cfLead Ball:\c- Purple shells. Coming from **Plutoni Incorporated**, these rounds shoot out a heavy ball of pure hurt. Despite the fact it's made of lead, it tends to keep its shape no matter how hard it hits something (some wonder if it actually IS made of lead, or if it's something else entirely). Having come out of such a place, it's no surprise that they also have some rather odd effects. It appears that, on certain occasions, the balls may emit odd sounds on impact, which in addition cause some form of potent shockwave around itself, increasing its speed in the process. This odd happening is listed as "Random Crits" in the store page.

\cfGolden Shell:\c- Gold-plated shells with a heavy metal body. A highly rare and expensive type of ammunition, with unmatched destructive power. Each round fires a sabot packing a high-grade, high-density **Explodium** charge, along with gold glitter (which is apparently just for show). Anything directly hit by it is guaranteed to be completely vaporized by the ensuing blast.

The wide range of compatible ammunition types makes the Spreadgun a rather versatile weapon, once you look past its tedious manual reloading. There are however plans to make a much more comfortable semi-automatic, recoil operated variant of this weapon, with prototypes already being tested.

\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Shoot the loaded shell.

\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Tap to select the next ammo type to be used on reload. Hold and then press primary fire to unload the current shell and leave the weapon empty.

\cfReloading:\c- Unload the current shell and load a new one. If the loaded shell was not spent, it will be returned to its ammo pool. Should there not be enough storage space for it, it will be dropped on the ground instead.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfYeah, this shit looks impractical af, and I don't know how no one has shot a hole through their hand reloading the damn thing. BUT, it does let you use all sorts of fun ammo. You've got the typical bread and butter of shells there, and then there's... Literal radioactive rock salt, that explodes, yeah, amazing. But then you look at what's right after that and... yeah.\c-

\cfHermann-senpai redirected me to nerdboi for those black shells, because they were his idea. So, let me explain. Telebrium is... a war crime. Plain and simple. We can kind of get away with it, though, because it's just mindless beasts that you're throwing it at. Still makes me uneasy, but hey, we're not using it on people, unlike the actual cases where it WAS used on people (good god, the stories about that).\c-

\cfAnyway, enough about crimes, let's talk about the purple bois. So these things are a serious crime, and THOSE TWO had to be involved of course. I'm pretty sure those things are NOT made of lead. This looks like that weird metal they work with, that I swear to fuck I can't even pronounce the name of. And it has... yes, RANDOM CRITS. Therein lies the crime, Demo-chan. Can't believe we've got that shit going on now. I absolutely lost it when I first saw it in action, and I'm sure you will, too.\c-

\cfLastly there's those golden bois. We can't buy them ourselves, so nerdo made another of his nerdy deals and said that he might reward you every now and then with one for eliminating "high level targets" or something like that. Can't wait to see what that shit is like, a fucking... golden shower of pain.\c-

\cf*cough*\c-

\cfPlease don't misinterpret that last thing I said, btw.\c-
