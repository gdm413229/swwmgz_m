**Hoagies**, also known as subs, are a popular type of American sandwich. Made from a bread roll and filled with a wide assortment of meats, cheeses and vegetables, it is quite a popular meal, not just on Earth, but also even in **Hell** itself.

As confirmed by **Archduke Cytho Valathor**, local source of Hell news in our world, it's become well known among civilian demons who have visited through summoning rituals, who would then later spread this to the rest of the population. Several establishments that serve them have been formed around the mainland and even in the outer reaches of the vast kingdom. Even **King Akusei** himself is known to enjoy them.

In recent years, this sandwich has become a symbol of peace, used by civilian demons in protest against the hostility towards humans. In a way, the hoagie represents that both civilizations can coexist.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfCan't believe a fucking sandwich could go that far. And it's true, I know it for a fact. You know Sakurai-san, right? Gloomy dude from the softdev department. He fancies himself a "summoner of hell beasts", but all he did was surround himself with hot succubi. So yeah, every time those gals come to pick him up, they always say something like "let's go for a juicy hoagie later".\c-

\cfWhy is it even so popular with them? I don't get it.\c-
