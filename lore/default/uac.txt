Founded in 2015 by **Thomas Kelliher** as a shell company of the **Union Aerospace Armed Forces (UAAF)**, the **UAC**'s rise to power began in 2025 with its famous **Joint Mars Expeditions**. After which their current headquarters, a vast complex known as **Mars City**, were built on the red planet, along with several posts on the moons of **Phobos** and **Deimos**. There is quite a lot of controversy surrounding this megacorporation, who not only is known to delve into all sorts of experimentation that has quite blatant potential for disaster (not to mention most of it having military applications), but also faces countless accusations of workers' rights violations.

Following the events of the **White Scar** in 2077, the UAC was one of the main bodies involved in the reconstruction of the fallen **United States**, eventually securing their position of power in the reformed **Union States**, as not just the largest military body on Earth, but also one with vast economic and political control.

In recent years, the UAC has been involved in teleportation technology experiments. Through these, they eventually found a way to travel to other worlds. Specifically, to **Hell**. Despite the clearly dangerous implications of such a thing, much was researched of that world ever since the first contact in 2144, and although hostility had been witnessed from the natives, it didn't seem that there was any sign of these creatures becoming a major threat... until a year had passed.

This arrival on Hell from the UAC had unfortunately coincided with a period of major political unrest, which in 2145 reached its boiling point, as the archdemon generals staged a coup, overthrowing the **Kuriste Royal Family**, and setting themselves up as the new rulers. Mad with power, they set their sights on war and conquest, and it just so happened that humans were there, so we became their first target.

Having turned a member of the UAC's science team to their side, he assisted them with the first incursion on Mars City, which served as a first test of their newly built armies. However, they were defeated, having severely underestimated the abilities of humans, and their superior firepower. Their initial plans had to be revised, their armies needed to be stronger, larger. Humanity would be overwhelmed by numbers alone. During the time until their next attack, it's estimated that the population of Hell grew from 370 million to 9.3 billion, thanks to an obscene expansion of their spawning grounds, and improvements on demonic biosynthesis.

In early 2148, with the UAC not having learned their lesson, teleportation experiments resumed, this time limited entirely to short-scale travels between the outposts on Phobos and Deimos. Over time, volunteers who had gone through the portals began to suffer hideous mutations, in some cases being said to result in eventual "full body explosion". It wasn't long until they realized what was happening: their portal was being hijacked. Soon enough, demon invaders began warping in from both sides, in vast numbers. Both moon bases eventually fell, and a detachment from Mars City was sent to investigate this "radio silence" that had so suddenly happened.

What happened then was the beginning of what's been called the **Doom Episodes**. As was told by the UAC following these events, one lone marine managed to, by his lonesome, defeat all the invading forces, taking the fight even to Hell itself. However, the exploits of the so-called **Doom Marine** only served to enrage the archdemon generals even more, and that's when the invasion of Earth began. Although most have seen this as "the end of the world as we know it", the UAC still sends a message of hope to all, saying that all will be resolved.

\cxSaya's Note:\c-
\cfOh, the "great and mighty" UAC, bunch of shit-eating capitalist pigs, that's what they are. Look right here, this is what unchecked capitalism does to you, y'all. Yeah, you can guess by now that I fucking hate these people.\c-

\cfSo... Illegal military experiments? Check. Fucking around with interdimensional travel? Check. Potentially causing the end of the world? Also check. These fuckers really ARE a stereotypical evil megacorp, fucking hell...\c-

\cfBut you know what? I'm not going to sit on my ass and wait for their supposed "problem fixer" legendary hero soldier boy to fix it all up. As if THAT is going to happen. No, this is precisely why YOU are here, Demo-chan. This is what you are destined to change (wow ok I'm starting to sound a bit uhhhh, cliche-y here). But yeah, we've prepared you for it, you are the ultimate combat robot, the pride of Akari Labs and all that jazz, you CAN save the world, I'm sure of it.\c-

What happened then was the beginning of what's been called the **Doom Episodes**. As was told by the UAC following these events, one lone marine managed to, by his lonesome, defeat all the invading forces, taking the fight even to Hell itself. However, the exploits of the so-called **Doom Marine** only served to enrage the archdemon generals even more, and that's when the invasion of Earth began. And, as soon as it did, it was quickly brought to an end. The **Demolitionist**, a collaborative effort of **Akari Labs** and its many associates, singlehandedly put an end to the invasion, efficiently eliminating every single demon that had come out from the portals, and after that, making their way through Hell itself, much like the Doom Marine, and defeating the **Icon of Sin**, who commanded the invading armies.

Following this event, the UAC suffered a major restructuring, as most of its board of directors had been lost during the invasions. Now free from its control, the US government tightly supervised their actions, ensuring that they would no longer become a liability. Despite this, three other incidents happened, despite much tighter security protocols. Within one of their bases on Io, yet again they continued their teleportation experiments, this time being prepared for anything. As predicted, a small group of demons came through, but they were swiftly dealt with. What they did NOT predict, however, was that this had merely been a distraction. An unidentified ship had suddenly approached the base, initially assumed to be the usual yearly supply drop. This ship was of demonic construction, imitating the very technology the UAC had. An overwhelming amount of demons were unleashed onto the base, and most were quickly killed or possessed. However, the Doom Marine was also there, and as expected, he once again did what he does best.

One other incident soon followed, within a research facility of undisclosed location. There, the UAC had been working on one way to actively prevent these invasions from ever happening, through something they called **Quantum Accelerator Devices**. These machines would allegedly serve to close any gates the demons could produce to enter our world, and they did, at first. One gate spawned within the facility, and although some demons managed to make their way in, it was promptly closed and these scarce invaders were gunned down. It seemed then that the experiment was a success, but the demons quickly caught on, and the next day, seven gates opened simultaneously throughout the facility. It took one hour for six of them to be closed, but at that point the invading forces had become overwhelming in numbers, and soon enough everything fell into chaos again. And sure enough, once again, the UAC decided to send their formidable errand boy to deal with it, and so he did, again, as usual. \cf[ed. note: Saya, your sarcasm is showing]\c-

With one final strike to the **"Gatekeeper"**, the titanic demon responsible for the creation of these gateways, it seemed that the invasions would finally be stopped for good. Sure enough, in the following years, all was quiet, and no more incidents were reported. The Doom Episodes were then archived, and the Doom Marine was decommissioned.

In 2150, the company finally closed off all of its teleportation experiments, and in a public announcement, CEO **Ian Kelliher** states that the company will now shift its main focus into repairing all the damages that their actions had brought to Earth. Something which, according to initial estimates, may take over fifty years.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfCrazy stuff, all because of the UAC being shit and bad. I'm happy though, because I got to see that pathetic brat's fall from glory, that idiot, who once claimed to be the "most important man in the world", now turned into the US government's personal lap dog. It's so hilarious my sides have gone into orbit, I swear.\c-

Something which, according to initial estimates, may take over fifty years.

Ten years after this announcement, some worrying news soon reached Earth. Demonic forces had been sighted on several abandoned UAC bases, which were previously thought to all having been thoroughly wiped by radiation bombings. Something had managed to survive there, and was steadily reviving the decayed corpses of the countless fallen demons. Seeing no other choice, the Doom Episodes are reopened, and the very disgruntled Doom Marine was re-commissioned and sent there, this time, after his eventual success, making the decision to stay in Hell, forever, to make sure the demons never attempt an attack ever again. Ever since then, no contact could be made with him.

What little information could be recovered from the other side of all this, that of Hell itself, is that his rampage was unstoppable. He defeated the remaining demon commanders. Tens of thousands of demons, in their mindless rage, all marched towards their deaths by his hand. There was hope among the civilian population that this one human, now rebaptized by the title of **Doom Slayer**, would put an end to the tyranny of the archdemon generals, but they had their plans for him. They were fully aware that should he make his way to the capital city of **Dis** once again, they would not be able to stop him. So a trap was set, and he fell right into it. It was then that **Erebus**, the leading general, banished him, far away, beyond the confines of this universe, so that he may never be able to return to this world.
