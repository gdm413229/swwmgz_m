The **Loudboi** is a simple and lightweight device for AI units. Easy to install and program, perfect for those building on a budget. There are a wide variety of options for the voice type, along with multiple language support, including Japanese. Those who are rather displeased with the uncannily "too human" default voice synthesis also have the option of enabling a built-in "robot voice" filter.

The **Akari Labs** community offers a variety of custom-made voice packs for this device, too. Please visit our forums for more information.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfHeh... I just love that cute voice you've got, it's a perfect complement to that sassy personality of yours. And what amuses me the most is how quickly you picked up all our little quirks and mannerisms, especially Ibuki's. In a way it's almost like you're sometimes a smol version of her, just without the tiddy.\c-

\cfUpdate: And then... Your true vocal chords as a maidbot came to be, no filters or anything, and my love for your charming voice only increased. My heart melts at the sound of it, hehehe...\c-
