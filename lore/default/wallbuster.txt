The **Wallbuster** is a beefy beast of a shotgun, sporting a total of 25 barrels divided into individually rotating 5-barrel cylinders. Like other shotguns from **Blackmann Arms**, it is chambered for the somewhat ludicrous 6-gauge. This huge weapon was commissioned by **Mr. BIG SHOT** himself, and of the many others **Blackmann Arms** has made for him, it is the only one that was made public, and it's said that the others may be even more ludicrous.

The internal mechanisms driving this weapon have such a degree of complexity that they've been described as **"Kraut Deep Space Magic"** by some. Only **Hermann E. Ischer** himself knows every detail about their operation. With each twist of the main trigger, the topmost barrel is primed, and then its cylinder spins counter-clockwise, with the next round ready for shooting. On a complete rotation, or when the secondary trigger is used, the main body spins afterwards, switching to another cylinder.

The Wallbuster is compatible with most types of 6ga shells distributed by Blackmann, although there are safety restrictions on some, namely dragon's breath, flechettes, and golden shells. This limits the range of ammunition usable to only these four types:

\cfStandard Buckshot:\c- Red shells. Exactly what it says on the tin. Quite lethal at short range, and with some extra reach due to the length of the weapon's barrels.

\cfMetal Slug:\c- Green shells. Very potent slugs that have a decent accuracy, even at longer ranges. Due to their size and weight, they can potentially penetrate multiple small targets.

\cfKinylum Saltshot:\c- Teal shells. Small chunks of Kinylum in its natural "salt" form. Once shot, they leave a trail of boiling hot plasma that remains in the air for a few moments before finally dissipating. In addition, the chunks will explode violently on contact with any surface, or once they "destabilize" (which unfortunately makes this type of ammunition ineffective at longer distances).

\cfLead Ball:\c- Purple shells. Coming from **Plutoni Incorporated**, these rounds shoot out a heavy ball of pure hurt. Despite the fact it's made of lead, it tends to keep its shape no matter how hard it hits something (some wonder if it actually IS made of lead, or if it's something else entirely). Having come out of such a place, it's no surprise that they also have some rather odd effects. It appears that, on certain occasions, the balls may emit odd sounds on impact, which in addition cause some form of potent shockwave around itself, increasing its speed in the process. This odd happening is listed as "Random Crits" in the store page.

Despite this limitation, with just these four types one can make of the Wallbuster a quite mighty companion. Especially taking into account the semi-automatic nature of the weapon, allowing for a quick succession of shots or even shooting multiple shells simultaneously.

\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Shoots the topmost barrel.

\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Shoots the topmost cylinder.

\cfTertiary Fire:\c- Shoots it all, if you really want to.

\cfReloading:\c- Once the side lever is pulled down, the cylinders can be safely detached and reloaded individually. For reloading on the go, it's recommended to have a **Magnetic Utility Belt** or similar at hand, as it will make this operation easier. Speed loaders are available for purchase from the Blackmann Arms website, or from authorized distributors. Clever operators might also choose to carry spare pre-loaded cylinders.

\cfTechniques:\c- True to its name, you can destroy all sorts of obstacles along the way, provided you're dealing enough damage relative to their size (requiring secondary or tertiary fire). This even includes locked doors, so you won't have to bother with key hunting anymore.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfOK so, this ballbusting hunk of metal. Yeah, now ain't that some good shit...\c-

\cfDon't worry about reloading this taking a long-ass time, btw. DemolitionOS comes with a quick reload routine that'll make it much easier for you. The ammo will be queued up in your Hammerspace, and then all you have to do is hold out your hand above the barrels, and they'll get deployed right inside. Nifty, huh? Taro did most of the work on that, so yeah, you can thank him.\c-

\cfOh and... y'know... this whole thing, that name and all, kinda makes me think of grandma a bit. I mean, if you change the first letter... Oh, do you hear those drums and that guitar? 'cause I sure do...\c-
