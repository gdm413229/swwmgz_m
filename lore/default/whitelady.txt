The **White Lady of Aldabura** is one of the most skilled mercenaries known within the **X'Animen Coalition**. As one of the **Aldabura**, moth-like humanoids native to the small planet of **Kantharo**, she is quite sensitive to bright lights, and is often easily charmed by them. At the same time, she's quite timid and prefers to focus on her work, rather than on any social interaction.

Despite her gentle appearance, she's quite deadly, being able to quickly tear her enemies to shreds with her bare hands. When she gets in the mood for murder, she is practically unstoppable, shrugging off everything that's thrown at her, not just due to her high pain threshold, but also her quick regenerative abilities.

The White Lady has worked for many individuals and organizations over the years, but recently, she's been hired by the **University of Nos-Kora** in order to collaborate with the **Demolitionist** in their missions.

Demolitionist, this message is for you. Obtaining the **Mashiro Plush** from our **Lucky Chanceboxes** shall make her contract effective, and thus, whenever you have a **Sankai Companion Lamp** in your possession, the White Lady shall readily work alongside you, and slay any enemies you may encounter.
