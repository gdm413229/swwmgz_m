**Xekke** is the largest nation in **Ixxeney**, itself also the largest planet of the **Zenna system**. Covering the mountainous regions west of the neighboring nation of **Devanikna**, it is the home of the **Xekkian**, a race of gigantic humanoids (averaging at 3.87 meters of height).

The nation is led by the king and queen of Xekke, currently **Mal Kuratagon**, grandson of madness deity **Maruku Sarahabinaku** and **Mysu Adasake**, youngest daughter of the **Adasake Mask Bearers**. In addition, the madness deity also serves as patron of the Xekkian people.

Among the various member civilizations of the **X'Animen Coalition**, the Xekkian are one of the most technologically advanced, though only a few steps behind the **Nukuri**. They are well known for all their achievements in the military field, and many of their weapons are famous throughout, as well as the strength of the titan armies. As a matter of fact, a majority of the coalition members often hire Xekkian mercenaries for their defense.

Structurally speaking, the whole nation is divided into only five cities, each of them very broadly separated from each other, and located in some strategic spot among the mountains. The smallest of them is the capital city of Adkesa, standing atop the tallest peak of Ixxeney, and from which it's said that the king can clearly see the other four cities. Also in the capital city is the Nukuri embassy, which in 1793 BC had fallen to a terrorist attack in response to general displeasure with the **Yathai Imperial Family**. It would remain in ruins until the fall of the empire, after which it was promptly rebuilt to signify the Xekkian people's approval of the **Nahkami Liberation Front**'s victory.

Of the people themselves, what is first noted is their eloquence. The Xekkas language spoken by all feels rather ominous and potent with each word spoken, well-suited for the intense personalities most of them exude. However, although they may appear to be fierce and imposing, they also know well to show kindness to those who need it, as is taught by their patron deity.
