The **Ynykron (Divine Fury)** is a high power energy weapon capable of efficiently erasing any living entities struck by its beam shot, both organic or artificial.

In its original incarnation, built by **Nukurines Mei Mess** during his time serving as lead engineer of **Nedoshiaan**'s empire, it could stand to even destroy the physical bodies of deities. As ammunition, it employed the concentrated energy extracted from slaves who had undergone years of constant torture, their suffering acting as fuel to bring forth this "Divine Fury".

When it was retrieved from the depths of the dead planet along with the other artifacts, it fell into the hands of the **Unissix Clan**, who have safeguarded it since then.

**Misa Unissix**, the young master crafter of the clan, had a lot of interest in weapons of legend, specifically, in making her own versions of them, so when she learned of the **Demolitionist** project, she saw this as the perfect opportunity to put her skills to the test once more, providing the Demoltionist with what would be **"the ultimate weapon to defeat all evil"**. Although at first she hit a wall due to the inability to dismantle and properly reverse engineer it, she eventually managed to get her hands on the original blueprints of the artifact, thanks to her grandfather from her father's side, **Nekorosen Nerukousei**, who was an old friend of Mei Mess.

The replica Ynykron uses a highly volatile mixture of exotic elements, in stable crystallized form, with considerable destructive power once a simple beam of light is directed through it. Misa sees this as a more "ethically reasonable" alternative to the intended ammunition of the original, additionally having the benefit of being easy to manufacture with the right materials and time. Nevertheless only two have been manufactured so far, one belonging to Misa herself, and the other being part of the Demolitionist's arsenal.

It should be noted that this weapon's usage is highly restricted. Special permission from a member of the Unissix clan is required.

\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Charges the shot. Once complete, pulling the trigger releases it. The beam's effective range is of approximately 400 meters, after which it will rapidly dissipate. Nothing can stop its advance, walls merely slow it down.

\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Reorients the ammo box, allowing for an alternate fire mode. A "vortex shot", a concentrated negative energy void that will pull in everything around itself for a short time, tearing it apart with strong tidal forces. It is generally not recommended to ever use this.

\cfReloading:\c- If the weapon is charging, or ready for shooting, this will be canceled and no ammunition will be used, but the weapon will have to vent for a while. Otherwise, a new crystal is loaded.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfSometimes I wonder if Misa actually realizes the dangers of the stuff she makes. This thing... it's maybe a bit too much, you know... Even compared to all the other stuff in the arsenal. I still ended up accepting it, anyway, because you know how I am, and how cute Misa is. I can't say no to that face. Besides, she made it for us, specifically.\c-

\cfSo yeah, here it is, "God's Cumshot" in all its glory. A motherfucking blast of blinding whiteness that just... absolutely fucking obliterates everything it's aimed at. Sure is a weapon, huh?\c-

\cfAlso, that alternate mode... I know you'll probably do it anyway out of curiosity. Just... be careful, okay?\c-

\cfOh, and just so you know, this thing is the reason why I make backups of your core before every mission. With any other weapon, I wouldn't be worried 'cause your body's pretty damn resilient, but this fucking thing is on a different level entirely. I gotta say it again, BE VERY CAREFUL. If you get caught in the blast you're gone forever, got it?\c-

\cfPS: We've confirmed it (well, Misa did, directly), this thing is effective against gods too. Not enough to kill, but it does have some very... notable destructive effects. Pretty crazy story, right? The next day after our wedding, Misa just popped up carrying her personal Ynykron and challenged the fucking goddess of war to a duel, right there and then. She ate up the whole damn blast, burned through most of her body leaving bones exposed. After that very painful experience, Misa was declared the second strongest warrior in the fucking universe, just like that. Oh yeah, and Erika described the experience as "being struck by a condensed supernova". That's metal as fuck.\c-

\cfAh... and I think this will be the last time we can use ours in a mission. Misa wants nothing to do with this anymore. Once it's all over we have to deliver it to her for destruction. A shame, but come on, I totally understand, this kind of weapon shouldn't exist.\c-
