**Zanaveth Nekuraku II** was born in 1969, as the single child of **Zanaveth Nekuraku I** and **Danakorn Kiyanou**. During her childhood, she showed great promise, being quite the quick learner, but rather than pressuring her to study harder, or putting her on a higher level place of study, her parents decided instead on letting her keep going at her own pace, which was something unheard of at the time.

Having finished secondary studies in 2005, Zanaveth II opted to spend some time working at the family business, **Nekuratek**, where she'd come to learn the ins and outs of AI and robotics, a field she had a lot of interest in. In 2009, Coinciding with the opening of new courses at the **University of Nos-Kora**, and under recommendation by her grandmother, **Zanata II**, Zanaveth II enrolled in **Extraspecies Studies**, as it appeared to be the perfect way for her to see the world, having only ever spent all of her life at the time in her home province of Akai.

As part of this course, Zanaveth II would travel all over the **X'Animen Coalition**, being introduced to the many species that inhabit the various allied planets, and studying their diverse cultures and stories. Zanaveth II also spent some time in the **Luna Research Institute**, between 2013 and 2014, learning about the **Ninuma** (the common word for humans across the coalition, coined by one of its co-founders). In 2016, as internal conflicts between warring clans of the **Devanikan** people had finally subdued, Zanaveth II took the chance to pay them a visit, previously having been unable to. It was during this visit that she met **Misa Azadeku Unissix**, her current wife. Zanaveth II graduated in 2019, after which she became a full time worker at the Luna Institute.

Following the **Luna Event** of 2021, in December of the same year, Zanaveth II came into contact with **Saya Miyamoto**, wishing to learn of her company and its involvements in AI and robotics. The two quickly became close friends, and as proof of this friendship, Zanaveth II agreed to provide **Akari Labs** with the advanced **Nekuronbot AI Framework** to further improve their creations.

Through her weekly visits to Japan, Zanaveth II became quite interested in the country's culture and entertainment. She was quick to point out notable similarities between them and the Nukuri, extending even to their language, something that greatly amused her. On social media, her usual posts would often be drowned out by extensive rants about anime and videogames, often intertwining with those of Saya Miyamoto.

In August 20th of 2042, Zanaveth II and Misa had a child, **Zanaveth Nekuraku III**, the first Nukuri born and raised on Earth. Due to the restrictive laws at the time, however, the family had to return to Nahkami once their child was ready to enter school by the age of 4. They would occasionally still visit Earth once again, during holidays, though.

In the wake of the **Nukuri Seventh World War** of 2068, Zanaveth II fled with her wife and child to **Sankaideriha** with the help of Nukuri witch **Saniuke Okusainaya**, old friend of her family. Two years later, after showing notable difficulties settling in, the family decided to leave Zanaveth III in Saya's care. This would last until 2077, when the **White Scar** incident prompted the expulsion of all Nukuri on Earth. Zanaveth III was then sent to live with her grandparents for the time being, until the end of the war in 2104, when her parents returned to Nahkami once again.

Since the formation of the **Nukuri Unified Government** in 2108, Zanaveth II holds the position of "Minister of Interspecies Relations", thanks in part to her outstanding achievements during her time as a student of the University of Nos-Kora.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfAhhhhhh, damn. She really is the sweetest and cutest gal I've ever met, let me tell ya. And it's one hell of an achievement for me to get this alien cutie to become a complete weeb too, heh...\c-

\cfOh man, meeting her was the best christmas gift ever. And also her smol cinnamon roll of a wife, too, huhuhu... Lucky devil, getting herself a girl like that. It was hella fun to hang out with them, especially because of how excited Zana-sama was about everything around the city. She was like a little kid in a candy shop at times. ABSOLUTELY FUCKING ADORABLE.\c-

\cfNowadays with the White Scar bullshit, we haven't been in touch much. Misa managed to visit a couple times, but it really wasn't the same, and I could tell that she wasn't enjoying it either. Yeah, fuck all that, I hope it ends someday and I can get the two in here again.\c-

As of 2171, Zanaveth II has also been involved in negotiations with the **Anarukon** people, as part of a "multiversal expansion" of the **Bleaknet**. In addition, through a deal with **Akari Labs**, Earth will also receive its own node to the Bleaknet Nexus. This last action is part of a greater plan to restore relations between Humans and Nukuri, putting an end to the White Scar Treaty.

\cfNow that the White Scar trash garbage is going to get all torn to shreds, I'm definitely looking forward to seeing her around once again. God, when she popped up after my wedding with Kirin-kun I almost broke down crying. I missed her so goddamn much, like... seriously.\c-
