1. Introduction
---------------

"Start reading from here"
  - Me in most of my previous projects' readme files

1.1. It's back!
- - - - - - - -

Surprise surprise, after a decade of delving into other works, I have made my
epic return! The SWWM series has been, in a way, "rebooted" through this here
project, and so it goes. The UT side of things is pretty much dead for me, I've
jumped ship to GZDoom and boy are the pastures far greener and tastier here.

1.2. The Story So Far
- - - - - - - - - - -

You are a Demolitionist, an autonomous combat unit devised by genius nerd
gremlin and CTO of Akari Labs Saya Miyamoto, with additional feature work from
various collaborators, including a sentient AI core by Nekuratek, a robust
chassis from Unissix Crafts, a durable battery from the Tach-Engine Technology
Institute, potent jets from Forx Aeronautics and last but not least, trusty
Hammerspace Containers from Cyrus Enterprises. Added to this is your arsenal,
also composed of various bits and pieces provided by partners of Saya herself,
making you one of the deadliest machines out there.

So, what is the purpose you were built for? Why, of course, to get rid of all
those pesky demons that have suddenly begun invading Earth. The UAC has ruined
everything once again, shoving their noses into things they shouldn't mess with
as your creator announces. Those idiots think just one of their puny space
marines can do the job, but she's not buying that. And so, that's why you're
here.

Time to explode some demon knees.


2. Inventory
------------

There's a whole lot of stuff here, trust me. This ain't your usual weapons
replacer with just seven lil' slots and that's it, oh no no, it goes deeper.

2.1. Weaponry
- - - - - - -

As you'd expect, there are some familiar faces here from the old SWWM and Ultra
Suite lineups, along with other hidden gems from unreleased works. And this
time, none of that cheap retexture bullshit. We're doing all-original model
work here, and it won't be ugly crap like in SWWM Platinum Ep2, oh no. I've
learned since then, I've had time to practice and get good. You'll see...

2.1.1. Deep Impact

Slot 1. Melee weapon. Available at start.
A staple of SWWM, compressed air gun cranked to eleven.
Primary fire blows, can deflect projectiles or push you and enemies around.
Secondary fire charges up a big thicc air bullet that rips hard.
Remember to keep this puppy recharged by pumping more air, especially for that
altfire, which requires 100% charge.

2.1.2. Pusher

Slot 1. Melee weapon.
What was going to be Ultra Suite 2's flagship melee weapon.
Primary fire drills around.
Secondary fire charges up a nice impaling action. The weapon will fly off if
there's nothing to hit, however, so be careful (unless you want it to).

2.1.3. Explodium Gun

Slot 2. Pistol. Available at start.
Another SWWM staple, the pocket exploder.
Primary fire just goes shoot. Stuff will blow up.
Secondary fire arms the mag and throws it as a grenade. Stronger the more
bullets you have left in it.
You can have two of them, by the way.

2.1.4. Spreadgun

Slot 3. Shotgun.
Coming from Instant Action 3, of all places, here's this thing.
Primary fire fires (duh).
Secondary fire switches the ammo type for next reload on tap. Holding it and
tapping the fire button will unload whatever ammo you have inside, in case you
want to use it on the other shotgun weapon.
Reload does what you'd expect it to do.
This thing may be unwieldy, but boy does it let you use some fun ammo types.

2.1.5. Wallbuster

Slot 4. Revolver shotgun.
A slight readjustment of a weapon from Total Destruction (cancelled).
Primary fire fires one barrel.
Secondary fire fires five barrels.
Tertiary fire fires all barrels.
Reload opens the reload menu. The instructions provided are self-explanatory.
Shooting multiple barrels may allow you to bust doors, bars, and other
structures, quite handy.

2.1.6. Eviscerator

Slot 5. Flak cannon.
It's back, and it's still pure unadulterated danmaku.
Primary fire shoots out all them metal bits.
Secondary fire shoots out the whole shell as a grenade.
Tertiary fire toggles between wide and tight spread.
A rare case of a weapon that doesn't need to reload, as it pulls in ammo from
your inventory directly.

2.1.7. Hellblazer

Slot 6. Rocket launcher.
We've seen its predecessors before, but now it's time for the new cool kid, the
long-awaited Mk3 model of this marriage between demonic and human technology.
Primary fire shoots the rocket. You can hold it to preload a couple more for a
burst attack. Tapping the opposite button while doing so will stop the preload.
Secondary fire launches it as a bouncing grenade. Same deal.
Tertiary fire cycles ammo types for next reload. But if you're holding in some
rockets, it will instead select targets for seeking.
Reload does what you'd expect. But when holding rockets, it clears any selected
seek targets. That's pretty much all.

2.1.8. Biospark Carbine

Slot 7. Energy weapon.
The Sparkster is back, but not in pog form however.
Primary fire shoots a beam, just like in its UnSX 1 incarnation.
Secondary fire shoots them balls. You can combo these two, obviously.
Tertiary fire ejects the ammo core turning it into a heatseeking orb of death.
Reload reloads. You can stack two mags together if you want, for more shoots,
at the price of some slight unstability (you might hurt yourself with it).

2.1.9. Silver Bullet JET

Slot 8. Sniper rifle.
The big and bulky brother of that unwieldy thing from Ultra Suite.
Primary fire (you guessed it) shoots.
Secondary fire cycles ammo types for reload on tap. On hold, tap primary fire
to manually cycle the bolt, should you need to.
Reload does what you'd expect.
Tertiary fire is a zoom. Hold to keep increasing the zoom factor, up to 16x.
Crouching with this weapon braces it and disengages the recoil compensator,
which can definitely cause some self-hurt from how hot the jet gas can get.

2.1.A. Candy Gun

Slot 9. Pistol (but very strong).
A tasty treat of sweetness and DEATH. From the lost forever™ Weirdweapons pack.
Primary fire does the thing.
Secondary fire does also the same thing as its slot 2 counterpart.
Holding secondary and primary fire (in that order) will switch to yeeting the
entire damn gun, for some absurd reason. It's very effective, though.
Considering that you can dispose of it like that, you can hold some spares.

2.1.B. Ynykron Artifact

Slot 0. Divine WMD (replica).
The good ol' Mortal Cannon, now in all its unadulterated glory.
Primary fire initiates the charge process. Once done, a second press ignites
the beam, destroying everything in a straight line, and causing some very nice
chain reactions too. Really good for massive hordes.
Secondary fire will flip the ammo box around. Don't do this, you don't want to
see what happens when you charge and fire it later. Don't say I didn't warn
you (you won't be able to, you'll be dead by then).
If you spotted a certain detail in the docs of the cancelled SWWM Z, you may
have noticed that the "Mortal Cannon" and "Ynykron" were separate weapons
there. Well, let's just say that funky lore reasons™ have merged both of them
together.

2.2. Powerups
- - - - - - -

Very much needed little things here.

2.2.1. Grilled Cheese Sandwich

The ultimate meal. Full 1000 health and full armor to boot. If you'd rather
keep it preserved nice and warm in your inventory, it might autoactivate to
prevent your untimely death, too. Note that you can't eat one again until
you're back at 500 health or lower.

2.2.2. Elemental Coating

A rehash of the ol' Barrier from other SWWM versions. Although it can't deflect
bullets anymore, it instead soaks up all elemental damage, allowing you to wade
through dangerous environmental hazards safely.

2.2.3. Ghost Artifact

Invisibility, basically. Have fun distracting enemies with it as they
fruitlessly try to attack literally nothing at the last spot they heard you.

2.2.4. Ragekit

It makes you angry, and also stronger and faster, but especially angry.
Eight times the melee damage, two times the fast, four times the damage
resistance... but boy are you going to scream.

2.2.5. Gravity Suppressor

Pops up on Heretic and Hexen. Lets you fly around freely without needing to
care about fuel usage from your jets.

2.2.6. Fucking Invinciball

Does what it says on the tin. Goes well with a glass of Sunny D.

2.2.7. Hammerspace Embiggener

A perfectly cromulent expansion to your ammo storage. Can have up to 8 active.

2.2.8. Universal Ammo Fabricator

What pops up as ammo in Hexen. Not exactly lottery, as it tends to prioritize
things nicely with what it builds.

2.2.9. Lämp

It's a floating magic lamp. It may attract moths.

2.2.A. Omnisight

You can see forever with this thing. A full automap, unlimited target scanning
in the minimap, and even highlights where keys and exits are. Quite handy.

2.2.B. Mykradvo Artifact

The Great Anomaly makes a return. Smite all those who dare try to attack you!

2.2.C. Devastation Sigil

A return of the olden "Complete Devastation" powerup of the early versions,
with a shiny new look, and some real attitude.

2.2.D. Divine Sprite

The Soul Spark from Platinum also makes a return, now with far more power.

2.2.E. Safety Tether

Sometimes you really just need to warp away from some nasty spot. This exists
for that very reason.

2.3. Armors
- - - - - -

You've got the war armor, pretty handy, robust, built from the same stuff as
your robot chassis, actually, though not as "high grade".
Then there's the blast suit, comfy and easy to wear, has very good splash
damage reduction, so keep that in mind.
And lastly there's the armor nuggets. These things can soak up damage like
crazy once you get them high enough. Above 100% they'll even start healing you!

2.4. Health
- - - - - -

We can go from measly health nuggets that add just one point of health, to the
four-faced tetrahedrons of health or the six-faced cubes. But all of these pale
in comparison to the mighty Refresher, which not only gives you a full 100 hp
boost, up to a cap of 500, but can also autoactivate should you take mortal
damage. Unlike the sandwiches, however, the Refresher might not be strong
enough to really prevent a lethal death.

2.5. Others
- - - - - -

Well, there's the keys, I guess. Those are always there.
And then, also the collectibles. Yup. You can find some fancy lil' boxes in
secret areas and whatnot, that might sometimes drop goodies, and some other
times little pieces of treasure that you might want to collect, as they can be
very valuable.


3. Credits
----------

This mod wouldn't have been possible if I had to create everything all by
myself (yeah, imagine me having to make SOUND EFFECTS and stuff, that'd be
impossible). Detailed credits are available in the credits.txt file. It's all
there, really.

3.1. UnSX Team Is
- - - - - - - - -

Still me, really. Just me. A shame, it is, but I really don't do well working
with other people.

3.2. Special Thanks
- - - - - - - - - -

Bless all of you from the Doom community that I love so much.
The very awesome and friend-shaped Marrub for making Lithium, one of the many
sources of inspiration for this here mod's little worldbuilding and some other
traits here and there (which you might easily notice).
CptSledge and Bunray for making me dive deep into the Doom Modiverse™ and its
interconnected lore and worldbuilding. You're a very fine pair of cool buds.
a1337spy for basically becoming the biggest fanboy of this mod. Glad you enjoy
it and its characters and lore (maybe a bit too much, but it's all in healthy
levels). You really are like the little brother I never had (gonna headpat ya).
Valerie Lavender for also supporting this mod and providing some neat little
things. You're a good bun and a good friend, stay awesome.
Kathy for being a real good friend and one who loves my lore and characters so
dearly. Stay cool, and keep creating.
Bouncy for being one of the few friends who can just stand there and listen to
me rant about lore for several hours straight. Many thanks.
Gutawer for not only being one of my ZScript senseis back in the day, but also
for creating the mighty Gutamatics library, which has made some fancy things
here possible.
KeksDose for being another ZScript mad genius and teaching me a nifty trick to
fuck around with VM aborts (which I then perfected).
ZZYZX and Nash for a handy piece of code to align stuff to slopes. The math's
hard, so I don't think I'd have figured it out on my own.
KynikossDragonn for being a good pet. You're still cute even if you deny it.
Lucy for having created the Tewi font, which I still use to this day. Wherever
you are, I hope you're doing well. We miss you.
All my wonderful patrons, of course, for supporting me economically so I can
basically keep working on what I love. It's a bit embarrassing to admit that I
wouldn't be able to afford HRT without your help, by the way.
