# (lines starting with this character are comments)
# if you want to make custom voice packs for SWWM GZ, you need to provide a
# file like this in the root of the zip/pk3/whatever, wads are not supported
# list the names of your voice types here and don't forget to define your voice
# lines using a similar format to the base game's:
#   voice/<name>/<group><#> for the sndinfo entries
#   SWWM_SUBS_<NAME>_<GROUP><#>, plus a SWWM_SUBS_<NAME>_N<GROUP> counter,
#   for the language strings
# with the exception of pain/death/grunt sounds (which should additionally have
# a $random entry in sndinfo), all lines you may want to register require a
# subtitle language string so they can be properly detected, but you can set
# them to an empty string if you don't want text to display. also don't forget
# to add a SWWM_VOICENAME_* language string for each voice type so they have a
# "human-readable" name in the options menu
