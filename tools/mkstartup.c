/*
	mkstartup.c : Makes a Hexen startup screen from provided images.
	Requires all the files to be in the same folder it's executed in.
	I didn't bother adding any checks so if this thing catches on fire it's
	your own damn fault. Add them yourself if you want, this tool was made
	for personal use anyway.
